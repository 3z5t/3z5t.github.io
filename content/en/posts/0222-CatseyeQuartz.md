## Birthstone for February 22nd: Cat's-eye Quartz

### Description of Cat's-eye Quartz

Cat's-eye Quartz, also known as Chrysoberyl Cat's-eye, is a unique and mesmerizing gemstone renowned for its distinctive appearance. The stone derives its name from the remarkable "cat's-eye" effect, which occurs due to the presence of fine, needle-like inclusions within the quartz. These inclusions, often made of rutile or other mineral fibers, cause a reflection of light that resembles the slit pupil of a cat's eye, giving the gemstone its enchanting, mystical appearance.

Cat's-eye Quartz comes in various colors, ranging from pale yellow to green and brown. However, the most prized stones feature a distinct, sharp line that appears to move across the surface of the stone when rotated, mimicking the eye of a cat. This captivating effect makes it highly sought after by collectors and jewelry lovers alike. It is also known for its high durability, ranking around 7 to 7.5 on the Mohs scale of hardness, which makes it suitable for various types of jewelry, from rings to pendants.

A glint, a gleam, an eye so bright,  
That watches still through day and night.  
In silence deep, the future calls,  
Within the stone, the vision falls.  

With eyes that see what none may know,

Through twists and turns, it shows the way,  
Guiding hearts where fate may stray.  

In every swirl, in every gleam,  
The future dances in a dream.  
The cat’s-eye gazes, sharp and true,  
A glimpse of all that waits for you.
