## Birthstone for August 17th: Pyrite

### Description of Pyrite

Pyrite, often referred to as "Fool's Gold," is a captivating mineral known for its metallic luster and striking golden hue. Its name comes from the Greek word _pyrites lithos_, meaning "stone that strikes fire," a nod to its ability to create sparks when struck against metal or stone. Pyrite is primarily composed of iron sulfide (FeS₂) and often forms in cubic or octahedral crystals, giving it a geometric allure.

This mineral is frequently found in sedimentary rocks, quartz veins, and coal beds, often in conjunction with other minerals. Its shimmering surface has made it a favorite for decorative purposes, but pyrite's appeal goes far beyond aesthetics. Its high density and unique properties have also drawn the interest of scientists and metaphysical practitioners alike.

Golden gleam, a shield so bright,  
Pyrite guards through day and night.  
A spark ignites, a fire within,  
Protective power, where dreams begin.

From ancient hands to modern hearts,
