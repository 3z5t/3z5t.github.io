### A Poem Inspired by Primrose

```
A star in the garden, bright and true,  
A whisper of spring in a sky of blue,  
Primrose blooms where the cold winds cease,  
A symbol of hope, of gentle peace.  

With petals soft, and colors bold,  
It tells of a story, quiet yet told,  
Of love that is pure, of beauty unspoken,  
In every bloom, a promise unbroken.  

It stands in the silence, waiting its turn,  
To paint the earth where the cold winds burn,  
And as it unfurls, it says to you,  
“Embrace the joy of the world anew.”  
```
