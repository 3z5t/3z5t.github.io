### Description of Lava Stone

Lava Stone, also known as Basalt, is a grounding and earthy gemstone formed from molten lava that has solidified after a volcanic eruption. Its porous texture and matte black or dark gray surface are reminiscent of its fiery origins. As a result of its unique formation, Lava Stone embodies both the intense energy of its volcanic source and the calming stability of its solidified form.

Lava Stone is lightweight, making it a popular choice for jewelry, particularly bracelets and necklaces.
