Beneath the skies of endless blue,  
A stone holds whispers, soft and true.  
Of days gone by, of dreams once shared,  
Of moments fleeting, love declared.  

Its hue recalls a gentle stream,  
A fleeting touch, a distant dream.  
Yet in its heart, the past remains,  
A soothing balm for all our pains.
