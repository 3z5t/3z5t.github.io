### Description of Nutgall Tree

The **Nutgall Tree**, also known as the **Aleppo Oak** (_Quercus infectoria_), is a unique and historically significant species of oak. This deciduous tree is native to the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is known for its distinctive galls—rounded growths on its branches and leaves caused by gall wasps. These galls, called nutgalls, have been valued for centuries for their high tannin content, which is used in dyes, inks, and traditional medicine.

The tree itself is a symbol of resilience and longevity, as it thrives in arid and rocky terrains. Its robust structure and deep roots reflect strength and adaptability, qualities admired across cultures. The Nutgall Tree's significance extends beyond its utility, standing as a testament to nature's ability to sustain life and provide resources even in challenging conditions.

### A Story Related to Nutgall Tree

In ancient Persian folklore, the Nutgall Tree was revered as a sacred plant connected to the goddess Anahita, the deity of fertility, healing, and wisdom. It was believed that the tree’s galls held divine properties, capable of protecting individuals from harm and bringing clarity to their decisions. Villagers would gather under the tree to seek blessings and offer prayers, trusting in its spiritual power.

One notable legend tells of a healer named Darya, who lived near the foothills of a forest rich with Nutgall Trees. During a time of drought, when crops failed, and despair loomed over the community, Darya turned to the trees for guidance. She used the galls to create a healing tonic that not only restored the villagers' health but also reignited their faith in overcoming adversity. To this day, the Nutgall Tree is remembered in the region as a symbol of hope and resilience.

In rocky soil, where few can stand,  
The Nutgall Tree graces the land.
