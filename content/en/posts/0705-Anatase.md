## Birthstone for July 5th: Anatase

### Description of Anatase

Anatase is a captivating and relatively rare gemstone that belongs to the titanium oxide mineral group. Its chemical formula is TiO₂, making it one of the few naturally occurring minerals that contain titanium in a crystalline form. Anatase is known for its striking brilliance and distinct appearance, often forming as sharp, pyramidal or tetragonal crystals. These crystals can range in color from golden yellow to deep blue, and sometimes even appear transparent with a hint of violet or brown.

Anatase is most commonly found in metamorphic rocks, where it forms under high-pressure conditions, and can also be found in igneous rocks and as an accessory mineral in certain sedimentary deposits. Though it is rarely used in mainstream jewelry, Anatase is prized by collectors for its fascinating crystal structure and vibrant hues.

Because of its rarity and aesthetic appeal, Anatase is not as commonly seen in gemstones as other minerals. However, its distinctive look and bright colors make it a desirable stone for those who appreciate unique, one-of-a-kind gems. Due to its relatively low hardness on the Mohs scale (5.5 to 6), Anatase requires careful handling and is typically used in collectors’ specimens or specialty jewelry rather than for everyday wear.

### Symbolism and meaning of Anatase: Future luck

Anatase is often regarded as a stone of future potential and prosperity, symbolizing the promise of good luck and favorable opportunities that lie ahead.
