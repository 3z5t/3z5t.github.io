```
Upon the peak where shadows lay,  
The Gentina blooms in soft array.  
A hue so deep, the sky it mirrors,  
Its beauty bound to quiet whispers.  

Through mountain winds, its tale is told,  
Of love and loss in meadows cold.  
A bloom that speaks of tender pain,  
Of joy once lost, yet still remains.  

Oh, Gentina, with petals blue,  
A heart’s lament, both pure and true.  
In every tear, your beauty lies,  
A fleeting dream beneath the skies.  
```
