### Description of Scapolite

Scapolite is a silicate mineral that forms in metamorphic rocks under high heat and pressure.

While Scapolite can occur in a variety of colors, from colorless to yellow, brown, and purple, it is most commonly found in shades of pale yellow or lavender. The crystal structure of Scapolite is tetragonal, meaning that it often forms elongated, prismatic crystals, making it highly distinctive in appearance.

Despite its relative rarity, Scapolite is appreciated by collectors and jewelers alike for its captivating aesthetic and the unique way light interacts with its transparent or translucent surface. Scapolite is often cut into faceted stones or polished cabochons, and its subtle, gentle hues make it ideal for creating elegant and understated jewelry.

Through the mists of time and space,  
A stone of future, full of grace,  
Scapolite, with light so clear,  
Guides the path, year after year.

Scapolite, your glow so pure,  
A beacon bright, of paths secure.
