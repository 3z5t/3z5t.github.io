## Birthstone for March 13th: Yellow Diamond

### Description of Yellow Diamond

Yellow Diamonds, also known as "canary diamonds" for their vibrant, sunny hues, are among the most captivating and rare gemstones in the world. These diamonds owe their dazzling yellow color to traces of nitrogen present during their formation. The nitrogen atoms absorb blue light, leaving behind the radiant yellow tones that make these diamonds so unique.

Yellow Diamonds range in color from soft, pale lemon to intense, rich gold. The more vivid and saturated the color, the more valuable the diamond. Among fancy-colored diamonds, yellow is one of the most sought-after hues due to its bright and cheerful energy. These diamonds are graded on the same criteria as colorless diamonds—cut, clarity, carat, and color—with the depth and purity of the yellow shade playing a key role in their appeal.

Primarily sourced from regions such as South Africa, Australia, and Russia, Yellow Diamonds are often associated with luxury and exclusivity. Their brilliance and warmth make them a popular choice for engagement rings, pendants, and other fine jewelry. Whether set in platinum, gold, or paired with other gemstones, Yellow Diamonds bring a sense of elegance and individuality to any piece.
