### A Poem Inspired by Jacinth

```
Beneath the amber skies that burn,  
Jacinth whispers, “All will turn.”  
A gleaming light in twilight’s shade,  
A gem of strength, for hearts afraid.

Its warmth enfolds, its fire calms,  
A steady touch, a soothing balm.  
Through storms of doubt, through trials steep,  
It guards the soul, its promise deep.

From myth and tale, its essence grew,  
Of safety found, of skies anew.  
Oh, jacinth bright, your glow so rare,  
A steadfast flame in every care.

With every facet, hope takes flight,  
A guiding star through endless night.  
Jacinth, your warmth, your gentle flare,  
Reassures us, always there.
```
