	In fields where morning dew does gleam,
	The Pimpernel awakes from dream,
	With petals bright, a simple grace,
	It greets the sun’s soft, warming face.
	
	Yet as the clouds begin to play,
	It folds its blooms and turns away,
	A humble dance of change and light,
	It whispers secrets of the night.
	
	A flower small, yet strong and true,
	It guards the skies of every hue,
	With colors bold and spirit clear,
	It speaks of change, both far and near.
	
	Oh Pimpernel, in sun and rain,
	Your silent song, a sweet refrain,
	Of modest charm and fleeting grace,
	In nature’s vast and sacred space.
