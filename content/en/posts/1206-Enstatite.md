## Birthstone for December 6th: Enstatite

For those born on **December 6th**, the birthstone is **Enstatite**, a gemstone that symbolizes a **pure sense of justice**. Known for its subtle yet powerful appearance, Enstatite is a member of the pyroxene mineral group and is often found in igneous rocks. Though not as commonly used in jewelry as some other gemstones, Enstatite carries profound metaphysical meanings, often associated with fairness, truth, and the balanced pursuit of justice. Let’s explore the key aspects of this fascinating stone, its symbolism, historical significance, and a poem that captures its essence.

### Description of Enstatite

Enstatite is a silicate mineral that belongs to the pyroxene group, a family of minerals commonly found in igneous rocks like basalt and peridotite. The mineral is typically a light to medium green, brown, or gray color, although it can sometimes appear as translucent or opaque with a shiny, reflective surface. Enstatite is composed primarily of magnesium and silica, giving it a dense and compact structure.

The gemstone variety of Enstatite is prized for its earthy tones and smooth texture. While its colors are often muted, the stone has a quiet, intrinsic beauty that makes it an intriguing choice for those seeking a deeper connection with nature and inner harmony. Enstatite has a relatively moderate hardness of 5.5 to 6 on the Mohs scale, which makes it suitable for use in various types of jewelry, though its rarity means that it is not as widely seen as other stones like quartz or garnet.

One notable characteristic of Enstatite is its **pleochroism**—the ability to display different colors when viewed from different angles. This subtle effect adds to the gemstone’s allure, enhancing its connection to the shifting balance of perspectives and truths.

In the quiet glow of earth’s embrace,  
A stone of justice takes its place,

In balance, fairness you will find,  
The scales of right, held in your grasp,

With quiet strength, it shows the way,  
To justice found in every day.
