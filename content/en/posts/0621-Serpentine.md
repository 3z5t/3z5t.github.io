### Description of Serpentine

Serpentine, often called the "serpent stone," is a striking gemstone known for its rich green hues and its often mottled, snake-like patterns. It is a group of minerals that vary in appearance, typically displaying shades of green, from a soft, pale olive to deeper emerald tones. Its name, "Serpentine," comes from its resemblance to the scales of a serpent, further enhancing the aura of mystery and power associated with this stone.

The primary mineral component of Serpentine is magnesium silicate, and it is commonly found in metamorphic rocks. While Serpentine stones are typically opaque, they can occasionally exhibit a soft translucency. Serpentine has been prized for centuries, used in everything from sculptures and ornamental objects to jewelry, particularly in ancient cultures.

In ancient cultures, Serpentine was considered a stone of great healing and defense. It was believed to provide a spiritual shield, allowing wearers to safeguard their mental and emotional well-being.

Serpentine encourages the wearer to tap into their inner strength, providing the courage and resilience needed to face challenges with confidence.

Beyond its protective qualities, Serpentine is also known for its ability to help release negative energy, especially fear and anxiety.

This calming energy, coupled with its protective qualities, makes Serpentine an ideal stone for those who need emotional balance and stability.

### A Poem Inspired by Serpentine

```
"Guardian of the Green"

Serpentine, guardian of stone,  
With verdant scales, so finely grown,  
You shield the soul from darkened skies,  
With ancient wisdom in your eyes.

A serpent’s power, wrapped in grace,  
A subtle force, you interlace,  
Through every heart, you carve your path,  
Guarding from the storm’s harsh wrath.

You whisper calm, you banish fear,  
A protector, ever near.  
In shadows deep or daylight bright,  
Serpentine guards with gentle might.

Wrap me in your verdant hue,  
Shield my soul, so pure, so true,  
Through every trial, every test,  
Serpentine, you give me rest.
```
