## Birthstone for August 30th: Rainbow Obsidian

### Description of Rainbow Obsidian

Rainbow Obsidian, also known as "Heaven’s Eye," is a volcanic glass with a stunning iridescence. While its base color appears deep black, light reveals concentric layers of vibrant colors—greens, purples, blues, and even golden hues. This striking phenomenon is caused by the diffraction of light within microscopic layers of the stone, creating a kaleidoscopic effect.

Primarily found in Mexico, Rainbow Obsidian is formed through the rapid cooling of lava, which prevents crystal formation. This process results in its smooth, glass-like surface. With a Mohs hardness of 5–5.5, it is more delicate than traditional crystals, requiring care in handling. Despite its fragility, Rainbow Obsidian is highly sought after for its beauty and metaphysical properties.

This gemstone is often used in jewelry and spiritual tools, celebrated for its ability to reveal hidden truths and promote emotional balance. Its mesmerizing play of colors symbolizes the depth and complexity of human emotions.

### A Poem Inspired by Rainbow Obsidian

```
A spectrum hidden, cloaked in black,  
A quiet gem that gives nothing back,  
Until the light, in gentle embrace,  
Reveals its depths, its radiant face.  

Through shadowed hues of purple, green,  
A thousand colors yet unseen,  
Each whisper tells of truths long buried,  
Of joys and sorrows once carried.  

Rainbow stone, you hold the key,  
To layers vast, to all I see,  
In your glow, I find my way,  
Through night’s depths to light of day.  

With every shade, my spirit grows,  
Through every gleam, my courage shows,  
Oh, Rainbow Obsidian, mirror divine,  
A treasure vast, a soul’s design.
```
