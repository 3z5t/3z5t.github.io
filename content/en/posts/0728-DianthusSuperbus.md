An ancient legend tells of a young shepherdess named Liana who tended her flock in the lush meadows where Dianthus superbus grew abundantly. Liana was known for her gentle spirit and kind heart, qualities that captured the attention of the moon god, Selunis. Each evening, Selunis would descend from the heavens to converse with Liana, captivated by her wisdom and purity.

The two formed an unbreakable bond, and Selunis gifted her a magical garland of Dianthus superbus, which he declared would symbolize his eternal love for her.
