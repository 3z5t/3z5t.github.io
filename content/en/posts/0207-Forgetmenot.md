### A Poem Inspired by Forget-me-not

```
In the quiet corners of the dawn,  
Where rivers wind and memories are drawn,  
A blue bloom whispers soft and true,  
“Don’t forget me, I’ll wait for you.”  

Beneath the skies, where moments fade,  
The flowers bloom, their vows are made,  
For love that time cannot erase,  
For hearts that still, in silence, trace.  
```
