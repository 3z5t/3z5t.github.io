## Birthstone for October 31st: Hawk's Eye

### Description of Hawk's Eye

Hawk’s Eye is a captivating gemstone, often referred to as a variety of Tiger’s Eye, but with its own unique characteristics. It is a form of quartz that displays a stunning blue to bluish-grey color with a silky, reflective sheen. The striking appearance of Hawk’s Eye comes from the fibrous structure of the stone, which causes it to exhibit a phenomenon known as chatoyancy—creating an effect where light seems to reflect off the surface in a way that mimics the eye of a hawk, sharp and penetrating.

Hawk’s Eye gets its name from the sharp, piercing qualities of the stone, which resemble the keen vision of the bird it’s named after. The blue-gray tones of Hawk’s Eye can range from pale sky blue to deeper, more metallic shades, creating a dramatic effect when the stone is polished. The gem is typically cut into cabochons or spheres to best showcase its unique chatoyant effect, and it is often used in jewelry, especially for pieces that are meant to have a powerful, grounding, and protective energy.

This gemstone is primarily found in South Africa, Australia, and the United States, and is often seen alongside its more well-known cousin, Tiger’s Eye. Though less commonly seen than its golden counterpart, Hawk’s Eye is a beautiful and highly symbolic stone with a range of metaphysical properties.

```
With a gaze as sharp as the hawk in flight,  
A stone that guides through day and night.  
Through skies of blue and gray so deep,  
It helps you soar, no need to sleep.

A glance so clear, a path so wide,  
With every turn, it’s by your side.  
A vision bold, a steady hand,  
It leads you forth, you’ll understand.

In the silence of its glowing hue,  
The answers come, both clear and true.  
Hawk’s Eye whispers, soft and wise,  
The way ahead is in your eyes.
```
