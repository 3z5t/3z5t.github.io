### Poem about Larkspur

	In gardens where the sunbeams dance,
	There rises tall with noble grace,
	The Larkspur's spires in bold expanse,
	A floral touch of nature’s lace.
	
	With hues of twilight’s gentle kiss,
	Or azure shades of morning sky,
	Each petal speaks of love and bliss,
	As breezes through the blossoms sigh.
	
	In whispers soft, it calls to hearts,
	To mend the wounds and heal the past,
	A symbol where affection starts,
	And joy in vibrant colors cast.
	
	So let the Larkspur’s beauty bloom,
	In every garden’s cherished space,
	A herald of the springtime’s room,
	Where love and peace in splendor trace.
	
	Through fleeting days and seasons’ flight,
	Its spires will stand with grace so pure,
	A floral ode to day and night,
	With meanings deep and love’s allure.
