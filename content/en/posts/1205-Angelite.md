### Description of Angelite

Angelite is a variety of anhydrite, a mineral composed primarily of calcium sulfate. Its name, “Angelite,” derives from its association with angelic energy and spiritual guidance. The stone is typically light blue to blue-gray in color, with a smooth, almost cloudy appearance. Angelite often forms in masses or nodules, which are then cut and polished for use in jewelry or as decorative objects.

Angelite has a smooth texture and is generally opaque, though it can sometimes exhibit slight translucency. It is not a particularly hard stone, with a Mohs hardness of around 3.5, making it somewhat fragile and better suited for use in pendants, necklaces, and other jewelry that is less likely to be subjected to impact. Despite its softness, Angelite’s delicate color and peaceful energy have made it a sought-after gemstone for those seeking healing and emotional balance.

In addition to its physical beauty, Angelite is also prized for its metaphysical properties, which are believed to aid in communication, clarity, and spiritual growth.
