### Poem about Jacob’s Ladder

**Jacob’s Ladder**

```
In gardens where the shadows play,
Where whispers of the springtime sway,
The Jacob’s Ladder climbs on high,
A stairway to the azure sky.

With leaves that reach for heavens blue,
And blossoms kissed by morning dew,
It weaves a tale of dreams untold,
Of aspirations bright and bold.

Its steps ascend with gentle grace,
A symbol of the heart’s embrace,
A journey through the trials faced,
A quest for light, a spirit chaste.

From earth to sky, it seeks the light,
A beacon in the fading night,
A ladder to the realms of gold,
Where hopes and dreams in silence hold.

So let the Jacob’s Ladder stand,
A testament to dreams so grand,
In every leaf and bloom so rare,
A promise of the heights we dare.

With every step, with every climb,
It guides us through the sands of time,
A floral ode to all we yearn,
And to the heights for which we yearn.
```
