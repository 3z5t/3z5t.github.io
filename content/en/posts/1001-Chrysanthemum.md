One of the most enduring legends surrounding the chrysanthemum comes from ancient China. According to the tale, an evil emperor learned of a magical flower that could grant eternal life. This flower was said to grow only on a distant island and could only be picked by the pure-hearted. The emperor sent a group of young, virtuous individuals to retrieve it.

Upon reaching the island, the group discovered the chrysanthemum, blooming in radiant beauty.

In autumn's glow, the chrysanthemum blooms,  
A jewel of life that dispels the gloom.  
Petals like whispers, soft and bright,
