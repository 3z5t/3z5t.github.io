### A Poem Inspired by Marcasite

```
A glint of silver, soft and bright,  
A mirror to the stars at night.  
Marcasite, a gem of lore,  
Holds whispers of the days of yore.  

Each facet shines with tales untold,  
Of hearts once warm, now silent, cold.  
It carries time, both loss and gain,  
A dance of joy, a touch of pain.  

Through longing's haze, it softly gleams,  
Awakening love in shadowed dreams.  
A keepsake worn, a bond renewed,  
A spark of life in solitude.  

Marcasite, your glow persists,  
A guide through memory’s gentle mists.  
You hold the past in tender view,  
And promise strength for what is new.  
```
