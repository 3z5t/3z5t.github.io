### Poem about Adiantum Pedatum

```
In shadowed glades where soft light wanes,
Where moss and fern in stillness reign,
The Maidenhair Fern unfurls with grace,
A silent beauty in its place.

With fan-shaped fronds of emerald hue,
It whispers secrets, old and true,
Of woodland paths where dreams may dwell,
In quiet shade, where mysteries swell.

Its delicate stems, a darkened thread,
Bear tales of calm and dreams unsaid,
In whispered tones, the fern does sing,
Of elegance in every spring.

Though seasons change and time may fade,
The Maidenhair’s soft charm won’t trade,
For in its leaves, a grace remains,
A timeless dance through shadowed lanes.

In gentle fronds and shaded light,
The Adiantum finds its right,
A symbol of the quiet strong,
A serene presence, a subtle song.
```
