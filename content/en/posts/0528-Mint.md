### A Poem Inspired by Mint

```
Beneath the sun’s warm, golden hue,  
A patch of green with morning dew,  
Its fragrance whispers, soft and light,  
A virtue’s strength, a pure delight.  

With every leaf, a tale unfolds,  
Of love and loss from legends old,  
Yet through the trials, it grows anew,  
A steadfast heart, forever true.  

Oh Mint, your essence fresh and clear,  
Brings calm and hope to all who near,  
A humble gift from earth and sky,  
A fragrant breath, a gentle sigh.  

In kitchen’s warmth or garden’s grace,  
You brighten hearts, you find your place,  
A symbol pure, you gently show,  
The path of virtue’s constant glow.  
```
