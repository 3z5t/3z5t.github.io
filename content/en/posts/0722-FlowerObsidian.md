### Description of Flower Obsidian

Flower Obsidian is a unique variety of obsidian, a natural volcanic glass that forms when molten lava cools rapidly. What sets Flower Obsidian apart is its distinctive floral-like patterns, which are created by spherulites—tiny crystalline inclusions that grow within the glassy matrix. These patterns often appear as light or cream-colored blooms against a dark black or brown background, giving the stone a striking and artistic appearance.

This gemstone is found in volcanic regions around the world, including Mexico, the United States, and parts of Europe. Its name reflects both its aesthetic appeal and its connection to nature. Flower Obsidian is typically cut and polished into cabochons, beads, and decorative items, showcasing its intricate patterns.

Its floral inclusions symbolize growth and transformation, aligning with its reputation as a stone of new beginnings.

In the darkness, blooms take flight,  
A garden born from molten night.  
With petals carved in glassy frame,
