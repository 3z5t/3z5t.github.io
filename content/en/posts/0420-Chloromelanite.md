### A Poem Inspired by Chloromelanite

```
In shadows deep, the gem does lie,  
A quiet blend of green and black sky.  
Falsehood whispers, veiling the sight,  
Truth emerges, a radiant light.  

Born of earth, where pressures collide,  
Chloromelanite tells of truths denied.  
A mirror of life, its hues proclaim,  
The dance of illusion and truth’s own flame.  

Hold it close, and you may find,  
The courage to face the doubting mind.  
In its depths, a story unfolds,  
Of truth unmasked, and lies untold.
```
