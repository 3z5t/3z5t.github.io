## Birthstone for July 18th: Labradorite Feldspar

### Description of Labradorite Feldspar

Labradorite, a captivating member of the feldspar family, is renowned for its stunning play of color known as _labradorescence_. This optical phenomenon causes flashes of blue, green, yellow, and even red to appear as light reflects off the stone's surface. The phenomenon is the result of light diffraction within the stone’s complex internal structure, where layers of feldspar minerals with varying refractive indices create a mesmerizing array of colors. These iridescent flashes make Labradorite one of the most magical and mystical gemstones in existence.

The gemstone itself is usually gray, brown, or colorless in its raw form, but once polished, its vibrant flashes come to life. Labradorite can range in transparency, but it is most commonly seen in semi-translucent forms, with the colors appearing strongest in stones that have a smooth, reflective surface. This stone has a hardness of 6 to 6.5 on the Mohs scale, making it suitable for use in various types of jewelry, though it must be handled with care due to its relative fragility.

Labradorite is found primarily in Canada (where it was first discovered in the Labrador region, hence the name), but it is also sourced from Madagascar, Russia, and Scandinavia. The gem has been revered for centuries, and its mystical properties have fascinated cultures around the world.

### Symbolism and meaning of Labradorite Feldspar: Secret meeting

Labradorite is a stone of transformation and protection, often associated with the exploration of the unknown and the unlocking of hidden truths. The symbolism behind _Secret meeting_ is deeply connected to Labradorite's ability to act as a bridge between the conscious and unconscious mind. This stone is believed to facilitate deeper insights into one's inner world, making it an ideal companion for those seeking hidden knowledge, spiritual wisdom, or new perspectives. It is thought to open the door to the "secret" parts of one's life—those hidden thoughts, desires, or emotions that may not be easily accessible through rational thought alone.

The concept of a secret meeting relates to moments of profound revelation or hidden encounters, whether with one’s inner self or with other people on a soul level. Labradorite encourages those who use it to open their hearts and minds to unseen possibilities. It is particularly effective in fostering communication between the conscious self and the spiritual realms, allowing people to access intuitive insights or messages from higher sources. This makes Labradorite an excellent stone for meditation, as it can help unlock dormant potentials and encourage deep self-reflection.

Additionally, Labradorite’s connection to transformation means that it often appears at times of significant change or pivotal life moments, like a "secret meeting" with destiny. It is a gemstone of progress, helping to overcome self-doubt and assisting in embracing new opportunities with confidence and clarity.
