### A Poem Inspired by Adularia

```
The Light of the Plan

Beneath the moon’s soft, guiding light,  
Adularia gleams in the quiet night.  
A glow that whispers, calm and clear,  
Of dreams to chase, of goals held near.  

Each shimmer speaks of paths to take,  
Of careful plans and moves to make.  
No hasty step, no rush, no flight,  
Just steady strides toward the light.  

The journey unfolds with wisdom’s grace,  
Each choice aligned, each step in place.  
Adularia glows, a steadfast guide,  
With every plan, the stars abide.  

Oh, gem of clarity, soft and wise,  
You teach us to see with open eyes.  
In your light, we chart our way,  
And build our dreams with each new day.
```
