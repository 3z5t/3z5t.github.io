## Birthstone for April 1st: Herkimer Diamond

### Description of Herkimer Diamond

Herkimer Diamond is a dazzling gemstone that, despite its name, is not a diamond at all but a remarkable variety of quartz. Known for its extraordinary clarity and naturally occurring double-terminated points, Herkimer Diamonds possess a diamond-like brilliance that has captivated gem enthusiasts for centuries. Found primarily in Herkimer County, New York, these crystals are celebrated for their unique formation and optical properties.

Herkimer Diamonds form in dolostone, a type of sedimentary rock, over hundreds of millions of years. Their distinct shape results from the natural growth process, as these crystals are free to develop fully without attachment to a host rock. This freedom of formation gives them their characteristic double points, making them a symbol of clarity and perfection.

While many Herkimer Diamonds are clear and brilliant, some may contain inclusions such as water, air bubbles, or black carbon deposits, adding to their uniqueness. Their natural beauty requires little to no cutting, as they are often used in jewelry or as standalone specimens in their raw, unpolished form.
