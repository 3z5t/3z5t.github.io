**Ode to Moss**

	In the quiet shade of the forest green,
	Where sunlight filters, soft and serene,
	There lies a carpet, lush and sweet,
	Moss, where earth and nature meet.
	
	Soft to touch, yet strong you stand,
	A velvet cloak on the forest land.
	You speak of time in whispered tones,
	Of ancient woods and mossy stones.
	
	Humility, in your verdant hue,
	A symbol of the pure and true.
	Maternal love, you softly weave,
	A cradle where the seedlings cleave.
	
	In your presence, calm and still,
	We find the peace, the heart's refill.
	Oh, Moss, in your gentle sway,
	You bring the light to a shadowed day.
