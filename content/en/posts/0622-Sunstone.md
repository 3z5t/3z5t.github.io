## Birthstone for June 22nd: Sunstone

### Description of Sunstone

Sunstone is a captivating gemstone that seems to capture the very essence of sunlight. Known for its warm, golden hues, Sunstone is a type of feldspar, a group of minerals commonly found in the Earth’s crust. It often displays an iridescent, metallic sheen known as _aventurescence_, which gives the stone a glowing, almost magical quality. This shimmering effect is caused by tiny platelets of hematite or goethite embedded in the mineral, which reflect light in a way that mimics the sparkle of the sun’s rays.

The most common colors of Sunstone range from golden yellow and peach to reddish-orange, with some stones even displaying a stunning play of colors. It is found in several parts of the world, including Norway, the U.S., and India. Throughout history, it has been valued for its beauty and its purported metaphysical properties. Sunstone’s radiant appearance and uplifting energy make it a popular choice for jewelry, from rings to necklaces, often worn to bring warmth and joy to the wearer.

In Norse mythology, Sunstone was thought to be a magical gem that could help sailors navigate by harnessing the power of the sun, especially on cloudy days. It was said that the stone could reveal the position of the sun by refracting light, acting as a compass and guide.

"Radiant Light"

In the heart of the stone, a flame does burn,  
A light of the sun, in every turn.  
Golden rays in a glowing dance,  
A symbol of joy, of love, of chance.  

Sunstone, with your shimmering gleam,  
You hold the warmth of a sunlit dream.  
A beacon of hope, of power untold,  
You brighten the soul, you make us bold.  

Through your hues, we find our way,  
In the darkness, you lead to day.  
A stone of light, of courage to bear,  
Sunstone, you shine beyond compare.  
```
