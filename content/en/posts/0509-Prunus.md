### Poem about Prunus

	In spring’s soft touch, a bloom unfolds,
	With petals fair and stories told,
	The Prunus flowers, white and pink,
	In fleeting grace, they softly sink.
	
	Amidst the branches bare and still,
	They whisper of the coming thrill,
	Of seasons turning, time’s embrace,
	In gentle hues, they find their place.
	
	Their beauty brief, yet wondrous bright,
	A fleeting gift in morning light,
	They speak of life’s ephemeral cheer,
	Of moments cherished, held so dear.
	
	O Prunus bloom, your fleeting dance,
	Is nature’s brief, enchanting trance,
	In every petal’s soft caress,
	We find a world of tenderness.
