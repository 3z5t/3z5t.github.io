### A Poem Inspired by Primrose

```
A bloom of youth, so bright and pure,  
A fleeting moment, soft and sure,  
The Primrose opens, bold yet sweet,  
With every petal, hope’s heartbeat.  

It whispers tales of love’s first bloom,  
Of dreams and wishes, through the gloom,  
A symbol of the heart’s soft sigh,  
The longing dreams that never die.  

In fields of green, it softly grows,  
A promise where the sunlight flows,  
A gentle voice in morning’s light,  
That speaks of youth, and love’s delight.  

Let Primrose teach us, soft and true,  
The beauty in the things we view,  
And cherish each longing heart's desire,  
For in its flame, we too aspire.  
```
