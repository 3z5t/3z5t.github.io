### A Poem Inspired by Yellow Apatite

```
Golden gem, with light so pure,  
A guide for hearts unsure.  
Through shadows deep, your glow reveals,  
The truths that time conceals.  

A crystal lens, so sharp, so bright,  
Unveiling secrets in the night.  
With every gleam, you softly say,  
“Look deeper now, don’t shy away.”  

Suspicion stirs, a gentle breeze,  
A call to question, seek, and seize.  
Yellow Apatite, your wisdom flows,  
Through paths where hidden knowledge grows.  

Illuminate the veiled unknown,  
And help us claim what is our own.  
A beacon clear, in golden light,  
You turn the dark to day’s delight.
```
