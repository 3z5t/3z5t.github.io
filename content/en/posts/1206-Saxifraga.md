According to an old legend from the Alpine regions of Europe, Saxifraga was a gift from the gods to symbolize unwavering love. A shepherd named Alaric fell deeply in love with a maiden named Elara, who lived in a distant valley. However, their union was forbidden due to a longstanding feud between their families. Undeterred, Alaric sought to prove his devotion by crossing the perilous mountains that separated them.

As he made his treacherous journey, the gods, moved by his love and determination, caused Saxifraga to bloom along the rocky path, guiding his way.

### A Poem Inspired by Saxifraga

```
Amid the stone and rugged crest,  
Where mountains shield the earth's unrest,  
A tender bloom begins to rise,  
A testament to love's deep ties.  

Its petals soft, yet steadfast hold,  
In icy winds, through stories told.  
Saxifraga, your beauty speaks,  
Of love enduring, strong yet meek.  

Though paths are rough, and skies may gray,  
Your blossoms light the darkened way.  
For in your heart, the truth does gleam,  
That love is life's eternal dream.  
```
