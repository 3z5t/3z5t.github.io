### Description of Calendula

**Calendula**, commonly known as **Marigold**, is a bright and cheerful flower that belongs to the _Asteraceae_ family. With its vivid hues of orange and yellow, Calendula is often associated with the warmth of the sun. Native to Southern Europe, the flower thrives in temperate climates and is widely cultivated for its beauty, medicinal properties, and symbolic significance.

Calendula blooms are characterized by their daisy-like appearance, with layered petals radiating from a central disk. These flowers are remarkably versatile, adorning gardens, being used in culinary creations, and playing a key role in herbal remedies. Known for their anti-inflammatory and healing properties, Calendula flowers are often infused in oils or teas to soothe skin ailments and promote wellness.

The plant’s ability to bloom continuously throughout the growing season has earned it the nickname “flower of the sun.” Calendula’s beauty, coupled with its practical uses, makes it a cherished addition to both gardens and herbal traditions worldwide.

### The Language of Flowers for Calendula: Sadness of Separation

In the language of flowers, **Calendula** symbolizes the **sadness of separation**, representing the longing and melancholy that accompany parting ways with a loved one. Despite its bright and sunny appearance, Calendula’s association with separation stems from its historical use in mourning rituals and its role as a symbol of remembrance.

The flower’s dual nature—vibrant yet poignant—reflects the bittersweet emotions of cherishing memories while facing the pain of loss or distance. Calendula reminds us that even in sadness, there is beauty to be found in the bonds we share with others.

The flower is often used to express sentiments of love and longing, offering comfort to those who grieve. Its persistent blooms serve as a metaphor for the enduring nature of love, even when faced with the sorrow of separation.

### A Story Related to Calendula

One of the most enduring legends associated with Calendula comes from ancient Roman mythology. The story tells of a young maiden named **Caltha**, who fell deeply in love with Apollo, the sun god. Each day, she would gaze longingly at the sun, hoping for Apollo’s attention and affection. However, her love remained unrequited, and her sorrow grew unbearable.

Heartbroken, Caltha withered away under the heat of the sun, consumed by her longing. Moved by her devotion, Apollo transformed her into a Calendula flower, ensuring that her beauty and spirit would live on, eternally basking in the sunlight. The flower’s vibrant color is said to represent the warmth of Apollo’s rays, while its association with sadness reflects Caltha’s unfulfilled love.

This tale underscores Calendula’s dual symbolism of warmth and sorrow, highlighting its role as a reminder of love’s complexities and the enduring hope that springs from loss.

```
Golden petals, soft and bright,  
You dance beneath the sun’s warm light.  
Yet in your heart, a tale of pain,  
A love that sought but hoped in vain.  

Through every tear, your beauty grows,  
A testament to what love knows.  
In sorrow’s shadow, light still gleams,  
A flower born of shattered dreams.  

Oh Calendula, bittersweet bloom,  
You bridge the joy and tender gloom.  
A symbol of what hearts hold dear,  
Even in parting, love stays near.
