## Birthstone for January 18th: Roselite

### Description of Roselite

Roselite is a rare and beautiful gemstone known for its striking pink to rose-red hue. This gemstone, often found in arid regions and volcanic rocks, is a member of the epidote mineral group. Its name comes from the Latin word _rosa_, meaning "rose," which reflects its delicate, pinkish color. While Roselite is not as well-known as other gemstones, it is cherished by collectors and enthusiasts for its unique appearance and rich history.

The gemstone is typically transparent to translucent, with a vitreous luster that adds to its overall allure. Roselite is often found in small crystals or masses, and it may exhibit a strong pleochroic effect, meaning it can display different colors when viewed from different angles. This characteristic adds to its mystique, making it all the more captivating. In some cases, Roselite may also contain inclusions, which add to its natural beauty and individuality.

Roselite’s rarity makes it a sought-after stone in the world of mineralogy. It is typically found in specific geological environments, often associated with other rare minerals like cobalt and arsenic. Although it is not commonly used in jewelry, Roselite is admired for its striking color and unique properties, making it a valuable specimen for collectors and gem enthusiasts.

### A poem inspired by Roselite

```
A glimmer soft, a rosy glow,  
A beacon through the night’s dark flow.  
In shadows deep, it shines so bright,  
A symbol of the dawn’s first light.

Through trials tough, through paths unknown,  
Roselite’s glow, a hope well-shown.  
A steady flame, a guiding star,  
Reminding us how strong we are.

In its hues, the heart takes flight,  
To rise again, to face the fight.  
With every tear, with every sigh,  
Roselite whispers, “Do not cry.”

For in the stone, there lies a truth,  
A gift of hope, of endless youth.  
Through every loss, through every fear,  
Roselite calls, “Hope is near.”
```
