## Birthstone for August 16th: Labradorite

### Description of Labradorite

Labradorite is a mesmerizing gemstone celebrated for its remarkable iridescence, known as labradorescence. This optical phenomenon creates a play of colors—shimmering blues, greens, golds, and even purples—that seem to dance across the stone's surface as it catches the light. Named after Labrador, Canada, where it was first discovered in 1770, this feldspar mineral is a favorite among gem enthusiasts for its mystical and captivating appearance.

The base color of labradorite is typically gray to dark gray, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant flashes of color within. This gemstone often appears in polished cabochons, beads, or raw, uncut forms, each showcasing its natural beauty. Labradorite’s unique qualities make it a popular choice for jewelry and spiritual tools.

On the Mohs scale, labradorite has a hardness of 6 to 6.5, making it durable enough for various adornments while still requiring care to maintain its beauty. Its enigmatic shimmer and earthy hues make labradorite a true gem of nature, admired by both gem collectors and metaphysical practitioners alike.
