For those born on **December 14th**, the birthstone is **Pink Sapphire**, a stunning gemstone known for its soft yet vibrant pink hues.

### Description of Pink Sapphire

Sapphire, a variety of corundum, comes in many colors, but the **Pink Sapphire** stands out for its gentle yet striking pink tones. These sapphires are often found in shades ranging from light, pastel pinks to more vibrant, intense fuchsias. The pink color in sapphires is caused by trace amounts of chromium or iron. The finest pink sapphires are often clear, with few inclusions, giving them a brilliant shine that captures light in a mesmerizing way. These stones are prized for their durability and hardness, ranking 9 on the Mohs scale, making them one of the hardest gemstones after diamonds.

Pink sapphires are often used in fine jewelry, particularly engagement rings and other pieces that symbolize lasting love. They are frequently found in both traditional and contemporary settings, sometimes alongside diamonds or other gemstones to enhance their beauty and emotional symbolism.

The primary sources of Pink Sapphire are Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Thailand, though these stones can also be found in other parts of the world. The gemstones from Sri Lanka, in particular, are famous for their vibrant and pure pink color, often referred to as "lotus pink" due to their delicate yet intense hue.

### Symbolism and meaning of Pink Sapphire: Pitifulness

The symbolism of **Pink Sapphire** centers around the concept of **pitifulness**, which may initially seem like a negative quality but is, in fact, deeply connected to empathy, understanding, and the ability to connect with others on an emotional level. The term "pitifulness" refers to a deep sensitivity toward the suffering of others, and in this context, Pink Sapphire is seen as a stone that fosters compassion and kindness.

While many gemstones are associated with strength and protection, Pink Sapphire is thought to encourage vulnerability, recognizing that our deepest connections with others often come from moments of emotional openness. It is a gemstone that reminds us to embrace our human emotions, allowing us to feel and empathize with the challenges faced by others. This stone is believed to bring emotional healing, offering comfort during times of sorrow or emotional distress.

In some cultures, Pink Sapphire is also associated with forgiveness and understanding. Its soft, nurturing energy helps to soothe troubled hearts and minds, offering a sense of peace during difficult times. It is thought to support the healing of emotional wounds and encourage a gentle approach to both ourselves and others.

The pink hue of the sapphire, however, was often linked with matters of the heart, representing love, romance, and emotional vulnerability.

In modern times, Pink Sapphire has become a popular choice for engagement rings and other jewelry that symbolizes lasting love and emotional depth. Many couples choose Pink Sapphire for its unique beauty and its symbolism of compassion and empathy in their relationship.
