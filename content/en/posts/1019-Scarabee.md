## Birthstone for October 19th: Scarabee

### Description of Scarabee

The Scarabee gemstone, often associated with the form of the sacred scarab beetle, is a symbol deeply rooted in ancient Egyptian culture. Traditionally crafted from precious stones like lapis lazuli, jasper, or turquoise, Scarabee talismans have been celebrated for their exquisite craftsmanship and spiritual significance.

The sacred scarab beetle itself, which inspired this gemstone's design, was revered for its life cycle that symbolized renewal and rebirth. The beetle's habit of rolling dung into a ball, laying its eggs inside, and burying it in the sand before new life emerged was seen as a metaphor for the sun's journey and the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.

Scarabees are typically small, intricately carved pieces, often used as amulets, seals, or adornments in ancient times. The gemstone reflects timeless elegance and spiritual depth, making it a cherished symbol of protection and eternity.

### Symbolism and Meaning of Scarabee: Resurrection, Eternal Life

The Scarabee is a potent emblem of **resurrection and eternal life**, representing the soul's immortality and the promise of renewal. In ancient Egyptian belief, the scarab beetle symbolized the divine cycle of rebirth, as its daily activity mirrored the sun god Ra's journey across the sky. This connection to the sun imbued Scarabee gemstones with the essence of life and the cosmic forces that sustain it.

According to legend, the scarab beetle was an earthly representation of Khepri, the god of creation, rebirth, and the rising sun. Khepri's daily task of rolling the sun across the sky was reflected in the beetle's habit of rolling its ball of dung, symbolizing life's continual renewal.
