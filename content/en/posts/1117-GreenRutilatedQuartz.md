## Birthstone for November 17th: Green Rutilated Quartz

### Description of Green Rutilated Quartz

Green Rutilated Quartz is a captivating variety of quartz that showcases stunning inclusions of green rutile, a mineral made of titanium dioxide. These thin, needle-like strands of rutile are often seen running through the quartz crystal, giving the gemstone its unique and striking appearance. The green coloration of the rutile is particularly notable, as it adds a fresh, vibrant touch to the clear, transparent quartz, resulting in a stone that is both elegant and intriguing.

Green Rutilated Quartz is typically clear or translucent, allowing light to dance through the quartz and highlight the beauty of the rutile inclusions. These inclusions may appear as fine, delicate threads or as more pronounced, thicker strands, and they are often found in patterns that resemble delicate, lacy formations. The green color of the rutile itself can vary from pale olive to deep emerald, depending on the specific conditions under which the mineral formed.

This gemstone is primarily found in Brazil, Madagascar, and the United States, among other locations where quartz is abundant. Green Rutilated Quartz is often polished into smooth cabochons or faceted stones for use in jewelry, including rings, pendants, and earrings. Its beauty and unique characteristics make it a favorite for collectors and jewelry enthusiasts alike.
