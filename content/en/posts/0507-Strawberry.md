	In gardens green, where sweetness grows,
	The Strawberry Leaf in silence shows,
	With trifoliate grace, so mild,
	It cradles nature's fruitful child.
	
	Its serrate edges, crisp and fine,
	A verdant touch to sunlit vine,
	In summer's warmth and autumn's chill,
	It stands resilient, steadfast still.
	
	Symbol of abundance, pure and true,
	Enduring through the seasons' hue,
	In modest dress, it holds its place,
	A quiet strength, a gentle grace.
	
	O Strawberry Leaf, in verdant cheer,
	You whisper secrets to the ear,
	Of fertility and life's sweet song,
	In your embrace, the heart belongs.
