### Description of Periwinkle

The **Periwinkle** (_Vinca minor_), also known as the creeping myrtle, is a charming evergreen plant celebrated for its glossy green leaves and delicate, star-shaped flowers. Native to Europe and Asia, this low-growing perennial is often used as ground cover due to its spreading nature and ability to thrive in shaded areas. The flowers, which typically bloom in soft shades of blue, violet, or white, are small but vibrant, creating a carpet of color during spring and early summer.

Periwinkle is highly adaptable and easy to grow, flourishing in a variety of soils and climates. Its ability to spread quickly makes it ideal for covering bare ground or adding texture and color to gardens. In addition to its ornamental appeal, Periwinkle has been used in traditional medicine for its alkaloid compounds, which were believed to have healing properties. Today, it is cherished as a symbol of natural elegance, resilience, and connection to the past.

Amidst the green, where shadows play,  
The Periwinkle lights the way.  
Its blooms so soft, in hues of blue,  
A whisper sweet, of days we knew.
