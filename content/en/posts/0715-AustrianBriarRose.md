### Poem about Briar Rose

	In woods where ancient secrets lie,
	Where tangled thorns and wild roses vie,
	The Briar Rose with petals fair,
	Unfolds its blooms with fragrant air.
	
	In tangled vines and brambles green,
	It guards the dreams, both lost and seen,
	A symbol of the love and lore,
	That echoes through the ages' core.
	
	Its thorns may pierce, its beauty stays,
	A testament to life's harsh ways,
	Yet in its bloom, a mystic grace,
	A promise of a sweet embrace.
	
	O Briar Rose, in shade and light,
	Your blossoms shine both day and night,
	With thorns that guard and petals bright,
	You weave a tale of pure delight.
	
	In every thorn, a tale is spun,
	Of battles fought and victories won,
	And in your blooms, a beauty bold,
	A story of the heart retold.
