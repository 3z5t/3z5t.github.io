### Description of White Opal

White Opal is a variety of opal characterized by a light, translucent body color, usually appearing in shades of white or pale cream. Its most remarkable feature is its **play-of-color**, a phenomenon where flashes of vibrant colors—like blue, green, red, yellow, and orange—shift and sparkle as the stone moves in the light. These colors create an ethereal, almost otherworldly appearance that has captivated people for centuries.

Unlike other types of opals, White Opal’s body color is predominantly light, which allows the play of color to shine through in an even more striking way. The **luster** of White Opal ranges from vitreous to resinous, and its **transparency** varies, with some stones being completely transparent and others more opaque.

White Opal is primarily sourced from regions in **Australia**, which is the world’s leading producer of opals, especially the famed **Lightning Ridge** and **Coober Pedy** areas. This gemstone forms in the cavities of sedimentary rock layers and is created when water-rich silica deposits slowly accumulate over time, resulting in the formation of these iridescent stones.
