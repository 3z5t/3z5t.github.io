	It dances in the sun’s warm sphere.
	
	Its leaves, like jewels, green and rare,
	Hold stories of the earth’s tough care,
	Yet in their strength, a grace is shown,
	In vibrant hues, the light has grown.
	
	A symbol of the spirit’s fight,
	Against the dark, it shines so bright,
	In every bloom, a tale is spun,
	Of joy and hope, beneath the sun.
	
	Resilient heart, and bright array,
	You chase the clouds of dullest gray,
	A beacon in the barren land,
	With beauty and with strength so grand.
