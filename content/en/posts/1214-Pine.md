```
Stalwart guardian of the hills,  
Through winter's frost and summer's thrills.  
With needles green and bark so tough,  
You teach us when the road gets rough.  

Beneath your boughs, the whispers stay,  
Of timeless strength, come what may.  
Your courage shines through every storm,  
A steadfast heart, your timeless form.  

Oh, Pine, so noble, tall, and true,  
A symbol bold for me and you.  
Bravery etched in each green spire,  
You lift the soul, you light the fire.  
```
