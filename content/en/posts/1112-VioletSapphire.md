## Birthstone for November 12th: Violet Sapphire

### Description of Violet Sapphire

Violet Sapphire is a striking and rare gemstone, a unique variation of the more common blue sapphire. It is characterized by its stunning purple hue, which ranges from soft lavender to deep, rich violet. This gemstone is formed from aluminum oxide, the same mineral family as other sapphires, but its color is influenced by the trace elements of iron and titanium, which give it that beautiful purple tint.

Violet Sapphire is prized for its clarity, brilliance, and remarkable color. Its color can appear differently under various lighting conditions, which adds to its allure. In bright light, it can appear more lavender or light purple, while in lower light, the deeper violet tones emerge, giving the gem a dynamic and ever-changing quality.

Like all sapphires, Violet Sapphire has a remarkable hardness of 9 on the Mohs scale, making it incredibly durable and suitable for use in various types of jewelry, including engagement rings, earrings, necklaces, and bracelets. This durability, combined with its beauty, has made it a beloved gemstone for centuries, particularly in fine jewelry pieces.

Violet sapphires are found in various regions across the globe, with notable sources in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Madagascar. However, because of its relative rarity, this gem is considered a treasure for those who seek something unique and special.

A stone that glows with twilight's hue,  
A shade of purple, deep and true.

To lead you to a life fulfilled,  
Where dreams are born and hearts are healed.
