	In tranquil pools where whispers play,
	The Water Lily graces day,
	With petals pure and leaves that float,
	Upon the pond, a gentle note.
	
	From depths below, it rises high,
	A bloom of grace beneath the sky,
	Its colors dance in morning light,
	A symbol of serene delight.
	
	Through murky waters, bold and clear,
	It finds the sun, it holds it near,
	A beacon of eternal bloom,
	In nature’s calm, it casts away gloom.
	
	O Water Lily, soft and bright,
	You grace the pond with pure delight,
	Your fleeting beauty, rare and grand,
	In peaceful waters, you take your stand.
