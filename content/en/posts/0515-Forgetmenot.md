### A Poem Inspired by Forget-me-not

```
In quiet streams where waters flow,  
The Forget-me-not begins to grow,  
A gentle bloom of sky-born hue,  
A whispered promise, pure and true.  

Its petals small, yet hearts it binds,  
A token left in love’s confines,  
To speak of ties that time won’t sever,  
A vow to cherish, now and ever.  

Through fleeting days and starlit skies,  
Its beauty lingers, never dies,  
For in its name, a plea is wrought,  
A tender cry: Forget me not.  

In love, in loss, in joy, in tears,  
Its bloom endures through all the years,  
A flower’s voice, a heart’s refrain,  
To keep love’s memory whole, unchained.  
```
