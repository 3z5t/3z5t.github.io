In Greek mythology, the Asphodel is famously associated with the underworld, particularly the **Asphodel Meadows**, a place where the souls of ordinary mortals resided after death. According to legend, these fields were neither a place of punishment nor paradise but a neutral realm where spirits could wander peacefully, surrounded by endless fields of Asphodel flowers. The serene beauty of these blooms symbolized eternal rest and the enduring memories of those who had passed.

One tale recounts the love story of **Orpheus and Eurydice**, where Orpheus, a gifted musician, ventured into the underworld to retrieve his beloved Eurydice.
