### Explanation of Nasturtium

**Nasturtium** (*Tropaeolum majus*) is a flowering plant that is cherished both for its ornamental beauty and its culinary uses.

- **Appearance:** Nasturtiums are known for their round, shield-like leaves and vibrant flowers that range in color from fiery reds and oranges to sunny yellows. The flowers have a unique spur at the back, which adds to their distinctive charm.

- **Botanical Significance:** Nasturtiums are valued not only for their ornamental appeal but also for their edible leaves and flowers, which have a peppery taste similar to watercress. Both the leaves and flowers are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic properties.

In the language of flowers, Nasturtium carries rich and varied meanings:

- **Patriotism:** The bright, bold colors of the Nasturtium are often associated with patriotic fervor and spirited pride.

	Upon the winds, their leaves do dance,
	A symbol of life's bold advance,

	From ancient lands across the sea,
	They brought a gift to you and me,
	A trophy bright of nature's art,
