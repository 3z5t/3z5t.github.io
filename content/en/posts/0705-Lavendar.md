	In fields where gentle breezes play,
	A purple haze of dawn's first ray,
	The Lavender stands tall and bright,
	A beacon in the soft moonlight.
	
	Its slender spikes of tender hue,
	In gardens kissed by morning dew,
	Whisper tales of calm and peace,
	Where worldly troubles find release.
	
	The fragrance, soft as summer’s sigh,
	Enfolds the heart, and lifts the eye,
	With every bloom, a touch of grace,
	A tranquil smile upon its face.
	
	In ancient tales and legends old,
	Its essence, cherished, has been told,
	Of love and beauty, pure and true,
	In every petal's purple view.
	
	O Lavender, your soothing charm,
	Brings gentle calm and soft alarm,
	A fragrant ode to all you give,
	A tender flower where dreams may live.
