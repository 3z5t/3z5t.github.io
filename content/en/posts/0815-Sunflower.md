### Description of Sunflower

The **Sunflower** (_Helianthus annuus_) is a towering annual plant admired for its radiant blooms that resemble the sun. Native to North America, the sunflower has become a universal symbol of happiness, warmth, and positivity. Its striking yellow petals encircle a dark central disk, creating a vivid contrast that captures the eye and the heart. The plant can grow impressively tall, often reaching heights of up to 10 feet, making it a standout in gardens and fields.

Sunflowers are heliotropic during their early growth stages, meaning their heads follow the sun's path across the sky. This unique trait not only symbolizes warmth and optimism but also reflects their need for light to thrive. Beyond their beauty, sunflowers are highly practical plants; their seeds are a valuable source of food and oil, while their tall stems and leaves provide shelter for small wildlife.

With their bold appearance and practical benefits, sunflowers have enchanted people across cultures for centuries. Their ability to grow in various climates and conditions further underscores their resilience, making them a favorite for gardeners and nature lovers alike.

Her unwavering gaze and devotion moved the gods, and they transformed her into a sunflower.

As a sunflower, Clytie could continue to follow the sun's path, turning her face toward its light from dawn to dusk. This enduring myth illustrates the sunflower's symbolic ties to devotion, faith, and the pursuit of light, even in the face of heartbreak.
