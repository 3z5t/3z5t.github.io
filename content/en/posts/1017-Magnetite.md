```
A stone of earth, a guiding force,  
Through storms of fear, it charts the course.  
With magnetic pull, it holds you near,  
Dispelling doubt, erasing fear.  

Its luster dark, a mirror clear,  
Reflects the strength you hold so dear.  
A bond to ground, a shield to keep,  
In trials vast, in waters deep.  

Oh, Magnetite, a guardian true,  
A beacon bright in shadows' hue.  
Through every fear, your power remains,  
A steady hand through life's terrains.
