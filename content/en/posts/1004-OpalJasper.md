In patterns soft, a secret lies,  
A gemstone’s dance beneath the skies.  
With opal’s gleam and jasper’s tone,  
It sings of balance all its own.  

A precise interval, a fleeting grace,  
A moment fixed in time and space.  
The rhythms turn, the cycles spin,

A harmony both vast and sweet.  
It guides us through the ebb and flow,  
A stone of timing we’ve come to know.
