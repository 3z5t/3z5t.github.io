	In shadows deep where secrets blend,
	The wormwood’s scent begins to wend,
	A bitter note, a tale untold,
	Of ancient rites and spirits bold.
	
	With silken leaves and golden hue,
	It weaves a spell of mystery’s brew,
	A plant of change, of deep regret,
	Of wisdom sought and truth beset.
	
	In absinthe’s glass, its essence gleams,
	A fleeting dance of shattered dreams,
	Yet in its heart, a sacred lore,
	Of healing touch and lore’s explore.
	
	O wormwood, with your mystic grace,
	You guard the night, a solemn face,
	A bridge to realms both dark and light,
	A guide through shadows, bold and bright.
