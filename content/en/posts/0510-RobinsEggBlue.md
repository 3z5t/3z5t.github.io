```
The Liberation of Blue

A soft whisper in the dawn,  
The robin’s song, the egg is born,  
A hue so bright, so light, so true,  
A symbol of a mind set free, too.

From earth to sky, the wings take flight,  
Unbound by doubt, embracing light,  
Like blue above, the heart can soar,  
A world of dreams to be explored.

Through colors soft, through whispers sweet,  
The mind unravels, finds its beat,  
In Robin’s egg, a vision clear,  
Of boundless thoughts, a life sincere.

No cage, no wall, no fear, no chain,  
Just open skies, no room for pain,  
The mind, once free, begins to see,  
The world that waits—its destiny.
```
