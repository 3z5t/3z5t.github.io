In shadows and in light, it calls,
A dance between the rise and fall,
Of joy and sorrow, both entwined,
In Hemimorphite, peace we find.

A crystal soft, yet strong it stands,
It guides the heart with gentle hands,
To reconcile the hearts’ two parts,
And bring together fractured hearts.

Oh stone of balance, calm and true,
In your embrace, the soul renews,
Bipolar minds, once torn apart,
Now find their strength within your heart.
```
