### A Poem Inspired by Hieracium

```
Beneath the sun’s unyielding glow,  
Where winds of fortune rarely blow,  
A tiny bloom of golden hue,  
Stands firm, resilient, ever true.  

Through rugged stone and barren ground,  
Its steadfast roots take hold, unbound.  
A symbol bold of human strive,  
Through effort's flame, we keep alive.  

O Hieracium, humble flame,  
You whisper softly effort’s name.  
A guide for hearts through trials steep,  
To sow, to build, and dreams to reap.  
```
