### A poem inspired by Jasper

```
"Stone of Restraint"

In the quiet earth, where roots grow deep,  
Jasper whispers secrets that we keep.  
A steady hand, a calm, clear mind,  
It guides the heart, to peace it binds.

In the storm of life, when chaos reigns,  
Jasper calms, and breaks the chains.  
A symbol of strength, of power untold,  
Of patience, wisdom, and hearts so bold.

With colors rich and patterns vast,  
It anchors us, holds us steadfast.  
A stone of balance, deep and true,  
To find self-control in all we do.

So let Jasper’s grace, its steady glow,  
Guide your steps as you grow.  
For in its embrace, you will find,  
The strength to master heart and mind.
```
