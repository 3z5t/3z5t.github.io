In the depths of the abyss, where silence is gold,  
A mystery unfolds, as stories are told.  
The endless night, where the stars seem to blend,  
A peaceful embrace, where all thoughts transcend.  

In the quiet we find, that the darkness is kind,  
It opens our hearts, and frees our mind.  
For in the deep abyss, with its infinite grace,  
We find our true selves, in its tranquil space.
```
