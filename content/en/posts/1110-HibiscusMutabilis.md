```
Beneath the morning's gentle light,  
A bloom awakens, pure and white.  
As midday sun begins to glow,  
Its blush emerges, soft and slow.  

By evening's dusk, a crimson hue,  
A testament to courage true.  
Each shade it wears, a fleeting dance,  
Of beauty's power, life's romance.  

Oh, flower of the changing hue,  
Your transient charm, forever true.  
You teach us all to see the grace,  
In moments brief, in time's embrace.
