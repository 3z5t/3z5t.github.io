### Description of Ulexite Cat's Eye

Ulexite is a unique and fascinating mineral, often recognized for its distinctive fiber-optic-like qualities. A variety of borate mineral, Ulexite is best known for its exceptional optical properties. The stone’s fibers naturally transmit light, which gives it the appearance of having a "cat’s eye" effect. When polished and cut in a cabochon shape, Ulexite forms an iridescent stripe across its surface, much like the slit-shaped eye of a cat, hence its name "Cat’s Eye."

The stone is typically white or colorless but can also come in shades of pale yellow, gray, and brown. Its fiber-optic effect occurs due to the structure of the mineral, with needle-like crystals of Ulexite aligned in a way that transmits light.

```
"Eye of the Heart"

Through the quiet depths of the soul's own gaze,  
Ulexite’s eye shines through the haze.  
A light that cuts the dark in two,  
Revealing truths both old and new.

In the heart, where secrets lie,  
This gem will lift the soul to fly.  
With vision clear, with wisdom bright,  
It guides you through the darkest night.

A glance within, a look without,  
The heart's true sight, without a doubt.  
Like the Cat’s Eye, sharp and clear,  
It shows the path we hold so dear.

With the Heart’s Eye open wide,  
We see the truth we cannot hide.  
In Ulexite, a guiding star,  
We see who we are, and who we are.
```
