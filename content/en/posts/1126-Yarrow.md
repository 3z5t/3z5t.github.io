```
Upon the meadow’s open sprawl,  
Stands Yarrow, proud, both fierce and tall.  
Its blossoms bright, a guiding light,  
Through trials dark, it shines so bright.  

A healer’s touch, a leader’s grace,  
In wild embrace, it finds its place.  
Through storms and sun, it firmly grows,  
Its steadfast heart, the world bestows.  

Oh, Yarrow, plant of strength and cheer,  
You lead the way, dispelling fear.  
With every bloom, you gently say,  
“Inspire the world, and light the way.”
