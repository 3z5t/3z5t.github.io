## Yarrow: The Resilient Healer of November 26th

As autumn's chill settles in and many plants retreat for winter, we turn our attention to a hardy perennial that has been revered for millennia - Yarrow. On November 26th, we celebrate this remarkable herb, exploring its unique characteristics, rich symbolism, and the profound impact it has had on human culture and traditional medicine throughout history.

### The Essence of Yarrow

Yarrow, scientifically known as Achillea millefolium, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, this versatile herb has naturalized in many parts of the world. Its common name is thought to derive from the Old English word "gearwe," which means "to prepare" or "to make ready," hinting at its long history of use.

Typically growing to heights of 1-3 feet, Yarrow forms upright stems adorned with finely divided, feathery leaves that give the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. But it's the flowers that truly make Yarrow a garden standout. From late spring through autumn, Yarrow produces flat-topped or domed clusters of tiny flowers, each cluster measuring 2-4 inches across. While white is the most common color, cultivars offer a range of hues including pink, red, and yellow.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Yarrow is its adaptability and resilience. It thrives in a variety of soil conditions, tolerates drought, and can withstand both heat and cold. This hardiness, combined with its long blooming period, makes Yarrow a valuable plant for pollinators, providing nectar and pollen when many other plants have finished flowering.

2. Divination Tool: In China, Yarrow stalks have been used for centuries in conjunction with the I Ching for divination purposes.

### A Poem: Ode to Yarrow

	In meadows wild and gardens tame,
	Your feathered leaves and flowers reign.
	Yarrow, healer of ancient lore,
	Your wisdom spans from shore to shore.
	
	Clusters white like summer clouds,
	Attract the bees in buzzing crowds.
	Through heat and drought, you standing tall,
	A healing balm for one and all.
	
	From Achilles' time to present day,
	Your strength and virtue hold their sway.
	In herb and charm, in lore and brew,
	Nature's resilience shines in you.
	
	Oh Yarrow, teach us how to be,
	Both tough and gentle, wild and free.
	To heal, protect, inspire, and grow,
	And ancient wisdom to bestow.

Let its feathery leaves inspire us to approach life with gentleness and flexibility, its sturdy stems remind us of our inner strength, and its long-lasting blooms encourage us to offer our gifts generously throughout all seasons of life.
