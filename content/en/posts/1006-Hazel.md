### Description of Hazel

The **Hazel** (_Corylus avellana_) is a deciduous shrub or small tree that belongs to the birch family, Betulaceae. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is recognized for its distinctive round leaves and clusters of edible nuts, which are encased in a leafy husk. Growing to heights of 10 to 20 feet, the Hazel tree thrives in temperate climates and is a common feature in woodlands, hedgerows, and gardens.

Hazel is particularly noted for its early blooming catkins, which appear in late winter or early spring. These pendulous, yellowish-green flowers are one of the first signs of the season's renewal. Its nuts, often referred to as hazelnuts, are a prized crop used in culinary delights, from chocolate spreads to savory dishes.

Beyond its practical uses, Hazel has deep symbolic and cultural roots. Throughout history, it has been associated with wisdom, protection, and inspiration. The tree’s supple branches are traditionally used for crafting wands and divining rods, emphasizing its mystical and practical significance. Whether valued for its beauty, utility, or spiritual symbolism, the Hazel remains a cherished part of the natural world.

### The Language of Flowers for Hazel: Reconciliation

In the language of flowers, **Hazel** represents **reconciliation**, symbolizing the act of mending differences and finding harmony. This association stems from the tree's connection to wisdom, fairness, and balance in ancient lore. Hazel reminds us of the importance of bridging divides, fostering understanding, and creating unity in our relationships and communities.

Reconciliation, like the Hazel tree’s ability to thrive in diverse environments, requires patience and adaptability. The tree's gentle presence in hedgerows, often forming natural boundaries, serves as a metaphor for the delicate balance required in resolving conflicts and fostering peace.

Offering Hazel as a symbolic gesture carries a profound message of goodwill, forgiveness, and the desire to heal rifts. Its presence encourages open communication and mutual understanding, serving as a timeless emblem of harmony and restored connections.

### A Story Related to Hazel

In Celtic mythology, the Hazel tree is revered as a source of wisdom and inspiration. One of the most famous legends involving Hazel is the story of the **Salmon of Knowledge**. According to Irish folklore, nine magical hazel trees grew around the Well of Wisdom, dropping their nuts into the water. These nuts were said to contain all the knowledge of the world.

A sacred salmon lived in the well and ate the hazelnuts, absorbing their wisdom. It was prophesied that whoever ate the salmon would gain unparalleled knowledge. The poet Finn Eces spent seven years trying to catch this fabled fish. When he finally succeeded, he instructed his apprentice, Fionn mac Cumhaill, to cook the salmon but not to taste it. However, while cooking, Fionn accidentally burned his thumb and instinctively placed it in his mouth, inadvertently gaining the wisdom of the salmon.

Fionn went on to become one of Ireland’s greatest heroes, known for his intelligence and fairness. The Hazel tree, central to this tale, is celebrated as a symbol of wisdom, reconciliation, and the transformative power of knowledge.

### A Poem Inspired by Hazel

```
Beneath the boughs of Hazel tree,  
Where whispers hum in harmony.  
A token of peace, its branches bend,  
Inviting hearts to love, to mend.  

Its nuts of wisdom gently fall,  
A gift of hope to one and all.  
In golden catkins swaying near,  
A promise blooms, so pure, sincere.  

Oh Hazel fair, your lesson true,  
To bridge divides and start anew.  
With roots in earth, and arms to sky,  
You teach us all to unify.  
```
