## Hazel Tree: The Magical Guardian of October 6th

As autumn's golden embrace tightens its hold on the world, we turn our attention to a tree that has captivated imaginations for millennia - the Hazel. On October 6th, we celebrate this enchanting tree, not for its flowers, but for its rich symbolism, delicious nuts, and the profound impact it has had on human culture and folklore.

### The Essence of Hazel Tree

The Hazel tree, scientifically known as Corylus, belongs to the birch family (Betulaceae). While there are several species, the most common is Corylus avellana, also known as the European Hazel or Common Hazel. These deciduous shrubs or small trees typically grow to heights of 3-8 meters, though some species can reach up to 15 meters.

Hazels are monoecious, meaning both male and female flowers occur on the same tree. The male flowers are particularly noticeable - long, yellow catkins that appear in early spring before the leaves, giving the tree a golden glow. The female flowers are much smaller and resemble tiny red tufts emerging from leaf buds.

The tree's leaves are rounded, with serrated edges and a pointed tip. They turn a warm yellow in autumn before falling. But it's the fruit of the Hazel - the hazelnut - that has made this tree a favorite of both humans and wildlife. The nuts are encased in a leafy husk and typically ripen in late summer to early autumn.

Hazel trees thrive in temperate climates and are native to Europe, Asia, and North America. They prefer well-drained soil and can grow in both sun and partial shade, often forming the understory in mixed woodlands.

### The Language of Trees: Hazel's Symbolic Meanings

While not traditionally included in the Victorian language of flowers, the Hazel tree carries rich symbolism across various cultures:

1. Wisdom and Knowledge: In many traditions, the Hazel is associated with deep wisdom and hidden knowledge.

2. Protection: Hazel wands or staffs were believed to offer protection against evil spirits.

3. Creativity and Inspiration: The tree is linked to poetic inspiration and artistic creativity.

4. Fertility and Abundance: The abundance of nuts produced by the Hazel symbolizes fertility and plenty.

5. Divination and Magic: Hazel has long been associated with divination practices and magical abilities.

6. Reconciliation: In some traditions, the Hazel represents peace-making and the resolution of conflicts.

### Stories, Myths, and Legends

The Hazel tree has woven itself deeply into human mythology and folklore:

1. Celtic Mythology: In Irish legend, nine hazel trees grew around the Well of Wisdom. Their nuts fell into the water and were eaten by salmon, who thereby gained all the world's knowledge. The poet Fionn mac Cumhaill gained this wisdom by eating one of these salmon.

2. Norse Mythology: The god Thor sheltered from a storm under a hazel tree, leading to the belief that hazel protects against lightning.

3. Roman Tradition: The Roman god Mercury carried a caduceus - a staff often depicted as being made of hazel and entwined with snakes.

4. European Folklore: Hazel twigs were often used in water-divining (dowsing), a practice of locating underground water sources.

5. British Tradition: "The Hazel Month" in the Celtic tree calendar falls between August 5 and September 1, a time associated with wisdom and creativity.

### A Poem: Ode to the Hazel

	Gentle Hazel, keeper of lore,
	Your catkins dance on wisdom's shore.
	Golden threads in spring's soft light,
	Harbinger of knowledge bright.
	
	Leaves so round, with edges fine,
	In autumn's glow, how you shine.
	But 'tis your fruit we cherish most,
	Sweet hazelnuts, nature's host.
	
	In legends old, you play your part,
	Of salmon wise and poet's art.
	Protection strong and visions true,
	In wand and staff, magic imbue.
	
	Oh Hazel tree, so fair and free,
	Custodian of mystery.
	In your shade, we seek to find,
	The hidden truths of heart and mind.

As we celebrate the Hazel tree on this October 6th, let us draw inspiration from its rich symbolism and enduring presence in human culture. In a world that often values the flashy and immediate, the Hazel reminds us of the quiet wisdom that comes from deep roots and patient growth.

May the Hazel inspire us to seek knowledge not just from books or screens, but from the natural world around us. Let it encourage us to tap into our own creativity, to find the poetry in our everyday lives. As we crack open a hazelnut or walk in a woodland glade, may we remember the countless generations who have done the same, connecting us to a timeless cycle of growth, harvest, and renewal.

In the Hazel, we find a symbol of resilience, of the strength that comes from flexibility. Its branches, traditionally used for weaving and crafting, remind us of the power of adaptability and the beauty that can emerge when we remain open to life's twists and turns.

Whether we encounter Hazel trees in forests, gardens, or simply in the products we enjoy, let them serve as reminders of the deep well of wisdom available to us when we pause to listen, observe, and connect with the natural world. Like the Hazel, may we offer our own gifts generously, provide shelter to those in need, and continue to grow in wisdom and grace throughout all seasons of our lives.
