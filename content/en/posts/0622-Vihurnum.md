	In gardens green where shadows play,
	The Viburnum blooms in soft array,
	With clusters white and berries bright,
	It graces day and warms the night.
	
	Through seasons’ turn, it stands so tall,
	A sentinel to summer’s call,
	Its fragrant blooms a gentle kiss,
	A touch of timeless, tender bliss.
	
	In autumn's chill and winter's freeze,
	The Viburnum sways with noble ease,
	Its leaves, like memories, softly fall,
	A dance of grace, a timeless thrall.
	
	O Viburnum, in your quiet might,
	You whisper tales of day and night,
	Of beauty true and bonds unbroken,
	In every leaf, a word unspoken.
