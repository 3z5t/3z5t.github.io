## Birthstone for July 13th: Chrysoberyl

### Description of Chrysoberyl

Chrysoberyl is a captivating gemstone renowned for its brilliance and radiant hues, ranging from yellow to green, and even golden hues. This stone is often mistaken for other gemstones due to its color-changing abilities, but its distinct charm lies in its clarity and lively shine. The mineral is primarily composed of beryllium aluminate and is a relatively rare gemstone, making it highly prized by collectors and jewelry enthusiasts alike.

The most famous form of Chrysoberyl is the "cat's eye" variety, which displays a unique, mesmerizing line of light that moves across the surface, much like a cat’s eye. This phenomenon is caused by the presence of needle-like inclusions that reflect light in a way that creates the optical effect. Chrysoberyl is known for its hardness and durability, with a rating of 8.5 on the Mohs scale, making it a perfect choice for fine jewelry.

### Symbolism and meaning of Chrysoberyl: Radiance

Chrysoberyl's radiant energy is said to bring balance to these aspects of life, helping the wearer stay centered and connected to their true self.

A gleam that glows with golden might,  
Chrysoberyl shines, a radiant light.  
Through darkest times, it finds a way,  
To brighten hearts, and light the day.
