Often, these water droplets appear as tiny inclusions or pockets within the stone, lending it a soft, ethereal quality.

This variety of quartz is typically clear or transparent, with the water droplets creating an illusion of movement and fluidity within the stone. These droplets can vary in size, shape, and clarity, creating one-of-a-kind specimens. The overall appearance of Quartz Water Drop Inside gives the stone an almost liquid-like feel, as if the water encapsulated within is constantly shifting with the light.
