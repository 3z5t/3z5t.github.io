```
A shimmer soft, a quiet hue,  
The ocean’s grace, a tranquil blue.  
Aqua Pearl, your glow serene,  
Holds the depths of what is keen.

With silent strength, you gently shine,  
A testament to the divine.  
In every curve, in every gleam,  
You whisper dignity, a dream.

Through tempests wild, through tides that turn,  
Your steady light will always burn.  
A symbol pure, of grace upheld,  
Within your glow, a world is held.

With poise and calm, you light the way,  
Through every night, to each new day.
