```
Upon tall stems, so proud and bright,  
Stock blooms in hues of pure delight,  
A fragrance soft, a timeless charm,  
A beauty that will keep hearts warm.  

Through spring’s embrace and summer’s glow,  
Its petals whisper what we know,  
That beauty true is more than skin,  
It lives in grace and grows within.  

A symbol strong, of love and light,  
It graces gardens, day and night,  
In every bloom, a story told,  
Of hearts that stay, of love that’s bold.  

Oh, Stock, so fair, so ever sweet,  
Eternal beauty, life's heartbeat,  
A flower’s grace, a poet’s muse,  
In you, the heart finds what it views.
