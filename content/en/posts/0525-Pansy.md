	In gardens where the sunlight gleams,
	A Pansy dances in the beams,
	With petals soft, and colors bright,
	A tapestry of pure delight.
	
	In hues of gold and violet deep,
	It stirs the heart from winter’s sleep,
	A bloom that speaks of thoughts unseen,
	Of love and joy in every sheen.
	
	Its gentle face, a work of art,
	A canvas where the colors start,
	To weave a tale of dreams and grace,
	A fleeting kiss on nature’s face.
	
	Oh, Pansy fair, with spirit free,
	You paint the world so vividly,
	A symbol of the heart’s own lore,
	In every petal, you restore.
