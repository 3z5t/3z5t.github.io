## Birthstone for April 5th: Colorless Sapphire

### Description of Colorless Sapphire

Colorless Sapphire, also known as white sapphire, is a striking gemstone that exudes purity and elegance. Unlike its more famous blue counterpart, colorless sapphire is completely transparent, allowing light to pass through with breathtaking clarity. This gem is composed of corundum, the same mineral that forms rubies and other sapphires, and owes its lack of color to the absence of trace elements like iron or titanium.

Colorless Sapphire is highly durable, ranking 9 on the Mohs scale of hardness, making it one of the toughest gemstones available. This durability, combined with its brilliance, makes it a popular choice for engagement rings and high-end jewelry. While it may resemble a diamond at first glance, its unique optical properties and slightly softer glow set it apart.

Mined in regions such as Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and Myanmar, Colorless Sapphire has become a symbol of understated luxury and timeless beauty. Its purity and brilliance make it a gemstone of deep symbolic significance, perfect for those seeking both elegance and meaning.
