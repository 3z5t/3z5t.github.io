## A Poem Inspired by Tiger Lily

```
Amid the summer’s golden light,  
A bloom of fire, bold and bright,  
With petals kissed by the sun’s embrace,  
The Tiger Lily finds its place.  

Its spotted face, so wild and free,  
Tells tales of love and destiny,  
A symbol fierce, with passion’s flame,  
A whispered call, a lover’s claim.  

Through fields it stands, so proud, so tall,  
Its beauty pierces, conquers all,  
In silent grace, it dares to plead,  
“Love me,” it says, in timeless need.  

A tear, a kiss, from ages past,  
The Lily blooms, its love will last,  
For in each petal’s burning hue,  
A promise deep, forever true.  
```
