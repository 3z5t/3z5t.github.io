### Poem about German Iris


	In gardens where the springtime’s light does gleam,
	The German Iris lifts its regal hue,
	A flower born from an eternal dream,
	Where shades of purple, gold, and white accrue.
	
	With sword-like leaves and petals soft and grand,
	You rise to greet the warming breath of spring,
	A symbol of the strength in beauty’s hand,
	Your colors speak of wisdom’s gentle wing.
	
	In myths of gods and tales of royal lore,
	You stand as beacon of the noble light,
	A herald of the values we adore,
	And friendships forged through dawn and fading night.
	
	Oh Iris, in your majesty so pure,
	You grace the earth with elegance and grace,
	A timeless bloom that’s both steadfast and sure,
	A floral crown for nature’s grand embrace.
	
	So let your blooms adorn the coming days,
	With hues that whisper tales of old and wise,
	For in your petals lies a world of praise,
	A legacy beneath the azure skies.
