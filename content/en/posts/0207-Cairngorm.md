```
In the heart of mountains high,  
Where ancient winds and shadows lie,  
A stone of earth, a gem of grace,  
The Cairngorm stands, a warm embrace.  

With hues of gold and amber light,  
It shields the soul from darkest night.  
A guide through paths both rough and steep,  
A stone to guard, a promise to keep.  

Discipline and strength it brings,  
To steady hands and soaring wings.  
A silent guard, a faithful friend,  
Cairngorm’s power shall never end.  

Through trials faced and storms endured,  
Its steady presence keeps us cured.  
With every step, we find our way,  
Protected by the light of day.  
```
