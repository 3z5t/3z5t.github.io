```
Softly carved by water’s hand,  
A shell of time, shaped by the sand.  
Through years untold, it found its place,  
A treasure formed in nature’s embrace.

Its lines and layers, calm and true,  
Whisper wisdom old and new.  
A steady course, the tide's refrain,  
Through joy and loss, through sun and rain.
