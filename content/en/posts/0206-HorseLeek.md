### A Poem Inspired by Horse-Leek

```
Amid the stone and desert’s grasp,  
A slender leaf in silence stands,  
Its roots, though deep in soil unkind,  
Offer strength with gentle hands.  

A home is built on hands like these,  
That toil and yield with no regret,  
Like Horse-Leek in the harshest breeze,  
Their love and work, a quiet debt.
```
