### Description of Geum

The **Geum**, commonly known as avens, is a hardy perennial belonging to the Rosaceae family. These cheerful flowers, often found in gardens and natural landscapes, are known for their vibrant and warm hues, ranging from yellow and orange to red. Geum plants typically grow in clumps, reaching a height of 12 to 24 inches, with slender stems that support their delicate, five-petaled blooms. Their soft, rounded leaves form a lovely base, enhancing their overall appeal.

Native to temperate regions worldwide, Geums are prized for their versatility and resilience. They thrive in full to partial sunlight and prefer well-drained soils, making them a low-maintenance choice for gardeners. Their long blooming season, often extending from late spring to midsummer, ensures they remain a highlight in gardens for months.

Geums have also gained a reputation for attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies, making them not only visually appealing but also ecologically valuable. Their understated elegance and ability to blend seamlessly into garden borders or wildflower meadows make them a beloved choice for gardeners and nature enthusiasts alike.
