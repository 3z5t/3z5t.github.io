	In quiet hedgerows, softly stands,
	The Hawthorn, with its gentle bands,
	Of flowers white and berries bright,
	A beacon in the springtime light.
	
	Its branches, strong, in winter’s chill,
	Stand guard with steadfast grace and will,
	While blossoms speak of love’s pure claim,
	And hopes that like the petals, flame.
	
	A sacred charm in faerie lore,
	It guards the heart and opens doors,
	To realms where dreams and myths entwine,
	Where magic and the real align.
	
	O Hawthorn, in your humble bloom,
	You chase away the winter’s gloom,
	With courage, love, and hope you bring,
	A promise of the joy of spring.
