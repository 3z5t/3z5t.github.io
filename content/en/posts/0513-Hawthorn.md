### Description of Hawthorn

The **Hawthorn** (_Crataegus monogyna_) is a small, deciduous tree or shrub that belongs to the rose family. Renowned for its thorny branches, delicate white or pink blossoms, and bright red berries, the hawthorn is a plant of both beauty and resilience. Native to Europe, North America, and Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found adorning hedgerows, woodlands, and gardens.

Hawthorn blossoms appear in late spring, filling the air with a subtle, sweet fragrance. These flowers give way to small, apple-like fruits called haws, which are loved by birds and have been used in traditional medicine and culinary recipes. The tree’s dense branches and thorns make it an ideal natural barrier, historically used in hedging and land division.

Symbolically, the hawthorn represents protection, hope, and love. Its enduring presence in folklore and mythology adds layers of meaning to its natural beauty, making it a cherished part of cultural and botanical heritage.

```
Amid the hedge, where thorns entwine,  
The Hawthorn blooms, a love divine,  
Its blossoms pure, a fleeting sight,  
A tender kiss of spring’s delight.  

Through ancient tales, its branches tell,  
Of sacred vows and magic’s spell,  
A guardian fierce, with thorns that guard,  
A symbol true of love’s regard.  

Oh Hawthorn tree, your steadfast grace,  
In every bloom, a lover’s trace,  
You stand through time, through joy and strife,  
A testament to love and life.  

Beneath your shade, where hearts entwine,  
We find our love, our hope, our sign,  
For only love your blossoms show,  
A bond that thrives, a heart’s true glow.
