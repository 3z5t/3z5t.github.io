**Whispers of the Willow**

	By the water’s edge, in gentle sway,
	The Weeping Willow stands, a quiet display,
	With branches long, like fingers drawn,
	They trace the sky, at dusk and dawn.
	
	A symbol of the tearful heart,
	Of grief and loss, and lives apart,
	Yet in your boughs, there lies a grace,
	A strength that time cannot erase.
	
	Your leaves, they dance, in whispers soft,
	A lullaby, where winds aloft,
	Do carry tales of olden days,
	Of ancient myths, and bygone ways.
	
	Oh, Willow, with your sorrowed mien,
	You weave a tale, serene, unseen,
	Of resilience in the face of strife,
	A testament to the circle of life.
