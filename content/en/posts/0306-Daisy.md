In Christian folklore, the Daisy is often linked to the Virgin Mary and is considered a symbol of her purity and innocence. It is said that the Daisy sprung from the tears of the Virgin Mary as she wept for her son, Jesus, during his crucifixion.

### Poetic Tribute to Daisy:

```plaintext
In fields of green, where sunlight beams,
The Daisy blooms, a sight so serene.
Its petals white as snow, with hearts so pure,
A symbol of innocence that will endure.

Oh, Daisy fair, with petals bright,
You fill the world with pure delight.
With every breeze, you dance and sway,
Bringing joy and cheer along the way.

In meadows vast and gardens small,
The Daisy blooms, enchanting all.
A reminder of life's simple grace,
In every petal, a smile on our face.
