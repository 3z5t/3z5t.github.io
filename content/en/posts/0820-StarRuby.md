## Birthstone for August 20th: Star Ruby

### Description of Star Ruby

The Star Ruby is one of nature's most captivating gemstones, renowned for its mesmerizing optical phenomenon known as asterism. When light hits the stone at just the right angle, a star-shaped pattern appears on its surface, creating a stunning visual effect. This star is caused by tiny needle-like inclusions of rutile within the ruby, which scatter light to form the star's rays.

Typically found in hues ranging from vibrant red to purplish-red, Star Rubies are a variety of the mineral corundum. Their brilliance and rich color are enhanced by their exceptional hardness, rating a 9 on the Mohs scale. This durability makes them not only visually appealing but also practical for use in jewelry.

Star Rubies are primarily sourced from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, with Myanmar producing some of the most prized specimens. These stones are often cabochon-cut to accentuate the asterism, making them a favorite among collectors and gemstone enthusiasts alike.

A star within, so bright, so true,  
In crimson depths, it guides anew.
