	In the garden's fragrant air,
	Orange blossoms pure and fair,
	White as snow, with scent divine,
	On branches green, they brightly shine.
	
	From distant lands where sun is bright,
	They journeyed far to share their light,
	With golden fruits and petals white,
	A symbol of life's sweet delight.
	
	In tales of old, in myths they grew,
	Guarded by nymphs, in skies so blue,
	A gift of love, a token sweet,
	Where earth and heavens gently meet.
	
	Oh, Orange tree, with fruits so bright,
	You fill our days with pure delight,
	In every blossom, leaf, and seed,
	A story rich of life we read.
