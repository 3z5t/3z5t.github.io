### A Poem Inspired by Copper

```
The Glow of Devotion

A metal of warmth, a heart’s embrace,  
In Copper’s glow, we find our place.  
Its fire burns soft, a steady flame,  
A slave to love, yet free of shame.  

Through time it bends, through change it flows,  
A symbol of love that endlessly grows.  
No chains of steel, but bonds of heart,  
In Copper’s touch, no love departs.  

Venus’s gift, both bright and strong,  
It sings of love, a timeless song.  
With every gleam, it softly speaks,  
Of hearts entwined, of love that seeks.  

Oh, Copper’s warmth, so pure, so true,  
A light for hearts, both old and new.  
A metal of passion, steadfast and kind,  
In love’s embrace, it’s always aligned.
```
