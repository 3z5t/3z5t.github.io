### Explanation of Cornflower

The Cornflower (*Centaurea cyanus*), also known as Bachelor’s Button, is a beautiful and hardy annual plant that thrives in a variety of environments. Here’s a detailed look at this delightful flower:

- **Appearance:** The Cornflower is renowned for its bright blue petals, though it can also come in shades of pink, white, and purple. Its flowers are made up of numerous florets, giving it a full and intricate appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 16 to 35 inches and has slender, grey-green leaves.
- **Growth and Care:** Cornflowers are easy to grow from seeds and prefer full sunlight and well-drained soil. They are often sown directly into the ground in early spring or late fall. Once established, they require minimal care and are drought-tolerant, making them a favorite in wildflower gardens and meadow plantings.
- **Uses:** Beyond their ornamental value, Cornflowers have been used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. They are also edible, adding a splash of color to salads and other dishes.
