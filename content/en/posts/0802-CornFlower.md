### Description of Corn Flower

The **Corn Flower**, scientifically known as _Centaurea cyanus_, is a striking wildflower renowned for its vivid blue petals. Originating in Europe, it is now found growing across various temperate regions, often in cornfields, hence its common name.

Typically, cornflowers grow to a height of 1-3 feet and thrive in sunny, well-drained locations. They bloom from late spring through summer, adorning landscapes with their dazzling azure hue.

These flowers are not only visually appealing but are also pollinator-friendly, attracting bees and butterflies.

Historically, the cornflower was considered a weed, but its aesthetic appeal and cultural significance transformed its reputation. It has been adopted as a national symbol in countries like Germany and Estonia, and its delicate petals are often used in herbal teas and as edible garnishes. The cornflower’s enduring charm lies in its simplicity and ability to bring a touch of joy to any setting.
