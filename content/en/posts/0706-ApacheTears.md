## Birthstone for July 6th: Apache Tears

### Description of Apache Tears

Apache Tears are a unique and evocative variety of obsidian, a naturally occurring volcanic glass. These stones are formed when lava from a volcanic eruption cools rapidly, trapping gas bubbles inside. The result is a smooth, black, translucent stone that, when cut and polished, often exhibits a beautiful, glassy shine.

What sets Apache Tears apart from other types of obsidian is their characteristic appearance. Unlike solid black obsidian, Apache Tears are typically smaller, more rounded, and often have a smoky or translucent quality. Their smooth surface is interrupted by tiny inclusions or "tears" that give them their distinctive look. The stone’s name comes from the legend associated with it—many people believe these inclusions symbolize the tears of grieving Apache women, mourning their lost loved ones.

In terms of physical properties, Apache Tears are relatively soft (5-5.5 on the Mohs hardness scale) and require gentle handling, particularly when used in jewelry. Despite their fragility, they are highly prized for their deep, enigmatic appearance and their metaphysical properties.

### Symbolism and meaning of Apache Tears: Mystery

Apache Tears are widely regarded as symbols of mystery, as their dark, opaque appearance invites curiosity and intrigue. The stone’s unique beauty is often said to mirror the unknown and the hidden depths within the human experience. Apache Tears represent the unexplained, the mysteries of life, and the lessons we learn from the secrets of the universe.

Beyond their physical allure, Apache Tears are believed to carry powerful metaphysical meanings. As the name suggests, these stones are associated with deep sorrow and mourning, but also with healing and the release of grief. They are considered to offer comfort during times of loss, helping to soothe emotional pain and encourage healing. Apache Tears are thought to absorb negative energies and promote emotional clarity, giving the wearer the strength to navigate difficult times.

The stone is also linked to spiritual mystery. It is believed to act as a guide to uncover the hidden aspects of life and self, assisting individuals in their journey of self-discovery. Apache Tears are said to encourage inner reflection, helping people to confront unresolved emotions, past traumas, and long-held fears. The stone offers the opportunity for healing through understanding and accepting the mysteries within oneself.

In terms of mystery, Apache Tears are also seen as protectors, guarding against negative influences and allowing the wearer to tap into their intuition and spiritual insights. They are believed to help individuals uncover truths that are not immediately apparent, guiding them toward the clarity they seek.

### Stories related to Apache Tears (legendary, cultural, historical, etc.)

The legend of Apache Tears is deeply rooted in Native American folklore. According to the story, a group of Apache warriors was pursued by U.S. cavalry forces during the late 1800s. After a long, harrowing chase, the warriors were trapped, and they chose to face death rather than surrender. In their final moments, the Apache women and children watched in grief as their loved ones fell. Unable to bear the pain of the loss, the women wept uncontrollably, and their tears fell to the ground, where they were said to crystallize into the stone we know today as Apache Tears.

The legend holds that these stones are the physical manifestation of the deep sorrow felt by the Apache people during this tragic time in their history. As such, Apache Tears have come to symbolize not just the pain of loss, but also the enduring strength and resilience of the Apache spirit. The stones are believed to carry the energy of both mourning and healing, offering comfort and solace to those who work with them.

In Native American culture, the Apache Tears are viewed as a powerful reminder to remember the past, while also healing from it. They encourage individuals to mourn their losses, but also to release grief and move forward with renewed strength and wisdom.

### A poem inspired by Apache Tears

```
"Echoes of the Silent Tears"

Beneath the moonlit sky so wide,  
Where whispers of the past collide,  
The Apache Tears, in shadows bright,  
Hold secrets of the endless night.  

Each drop a story, deeply sown,  
Of battles fought, of hearts alone.  
Yet in the dark, a light still gleams,  
The power to heal and chase the dreams.  

Tears that fell, from souls so pure,  
Now crystalized, a heart’s allure.  
With every glint, with every shine,  
A mystery, forever divine.  

Through grief and loss, through times of fear,  
The tears remind us to draw near.  
For even in the darkest hue,  
There’s strength to rise, a life anew.  
```
