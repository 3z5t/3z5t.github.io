### Explanation of Water Lily

**Water Lilies** (genus *Nymphaea*) are aquatic plants that float gracefully on the surface of still or slow-moving water. Native to both tropical and temperate regions, they are characterized by their large, round leaves that rest atop the water, and their striking flowers that emerge from beneath the surface.

Water Lilies have a wide variety of species, including the well-known **Nymphaea odorata** (American White Water Lily) and **Nymphaea caerulea** (Blue Lotus). These flowers can be white, pink, yellow, or blue, with petals arranged in layers that unfurl to reveal their delicate beauty. Their large, waxy leaves help in flotation and provide a habitat for various aquatic life forms.

In their natural habitat, Water Lilies are often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. They play a crucial role in their ecosystems by providing shade and shelter for aquatic organisms, and their roots help stabilize the sediment in the water.

### Poem about Water Lily

	Amidst the tranquil, glassy pond,
	Where sunlight dances, soft and fond,
	The Water Lily spreads its grace,
	A bloom of calm in nature’s space.
	
	From murky depths it lifts its head,
	In hues of white and gold it’s spread,
	With petals pure and leaves that glide,
	It whispers peace where waters bide.
	
	A symbol of the soul’s ascent,
	From shadows deep to realms of light,
	Its tranquil bloom, a testament,
	To journeys made through darkest night.
	
	Oh Water Lily, floating free,
	In mirrored depths, you calmly be,
	A vision of serene delight,
	That graces both the day and night.
	
	So let your quiet strength inspire,
	As you emerge from waters’ mire,
	To show us all, through trials long,
	That beauty blooms where we belong.
