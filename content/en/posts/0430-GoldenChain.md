### Poem about Golden Chain


	In spring’s embrace, where sunbeams play,
	The Golden Chain begins its sway,
	With cascades of gold that softly fall,
	A radiant dance, a floral call.
	
	Each pendant bloom, a golden stream,
	A vision from a sunlit dream,
	In gardens bright, where shadows fade,
	A tapestry of light is laid.
	
	You whisper tales of fleeting grace,
	Of moments bright in time and space,
	With every bloom, a joy revealed,
	A fleeting beauty, softly sealed.
	
	In joy and light, your petals sway,
	A golden curtain in the day,
	Reminding us with gentle cheer,
	To treasure moments, fleeting, dear.
	
	So let the Golden Chain’s embrace,
	Infuse our hearts with light and grace,
	In every bloom, a story told,
	Of beauty fleeting, pure, and gold.
