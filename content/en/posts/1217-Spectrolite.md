## Birthstone for December 17th: Spectrolite

For those born on **December 17th**, the birthstone is the captivating **Spectrolite**, a gemstone that embodies the intensity of **passionate, dangerous love**. With its fiery play of color and ethereal beauty, Spectrolite is not just a gem; it's a symbol of deep emotions and the unpredictable nature of love. In this post, we’ll explore the features that make Spectrolite such a striking stone, the symbolism of its powerful meaning, and how it has been viewed in history and culture.

### Description of Spectrolite

Spectrolite is a rare and stunning variety of **labradorite**, a member of the feldspar family. What sets Spectrolite apart from other labradorite stones is its exceptional, vibrant color play or "labradorescence." Spectrolite’s colors shift dramatically as the stone is turned in the light, revealing a spectrum of vivid hues like blue, green, gold, orange, and purple. This mesmerizing display is caused by the internal structure of the mineral, which reflects light in an almost otherworldly manner, making Spectrolite appear to glow from within.

The stone itself typically appears dark or grayish when viewed from certain angles, but when the light catches its surface just right, it reveals a spectrum of rainbow colors that can be breathtaking. Because of this unique optical effect, Spectrolite is highly prized by collectors and is often used in fine jewelry, including rings, necklaces, and bracelets.

Found primarily in **Finland** and a few other regions, Spectrolite is a relatively rare gemstone, which adds to its allure and mystique. The stone's natural, slightly iridescent finish also makes it a favorite among those who appreciate gems with a touch of the magical and mysterious.

### Symbolism and meaning of Spectrolite: Passionate, Dangerous Love

The meaning behind Spectrolite is one of **passionate, dangerous love**, an emotional intensity that can both ignite and consume. The shifting colors of the gemstone symbolize the changing and unpredictable nature of love itself—how it can go from bright and joyful to dark and stormy in an instant. Spectrolite embodies the idea of love that is all-encompassing, exhilarating, and sometimes overwhelming. It’s the kind of love that pulls people in with an almost magnetic force, offering both beauty and danger in equal measure.

This gemstone is often associated with the emotions that accompany **uncontrollable desire** and **fierce attraction**, but it also carries the message of the risks involved when one surrenders to such intense emotions. Much like passionate love, Spectrolite can be captivating and enchanting, but it can also be unpredictable and fraught with challenges.

For those who are drawn to Spectrolite, it may symbolize an invitation to embrace the power of love, even when it seems unpredictable or dangerous. It encourages individuals to accept both the light and dark aspects of love, knowing that both joy and heartache are part of the journey.

### Stories related to Spectrolite (legendary, cultural, historical, etc.)

It’s said that the stone can unlock deeper emotional awareness and bring clarity to the complexities of love and relationships.

### A Poem Inspired by Spectrolite

```
In the depths of twilight's embrace,  
A shimmer glows in soft grace,  
Colors of flame, wild and free,  
Dancing in the heart of me.

A love that burns with furious might,  
Flickering shadows in the night,  
Spectrolite, you shine so bright,  
In your light, I lose my sight.

Fierce as the storm, yet gentle as rain,  
Love’s sweet joy, and love’s deep pain,  
In your colors, I see my soul—  
A passion that consumes, makes me whole.

Oh, Spectrolite, with colors that blend,  
You are the love that has no end,  
But know this truth, as dark as the skies:  
In your fire, I see my demise.
```
