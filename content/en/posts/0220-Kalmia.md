### Description of Kalmia

**Kalmia**, commonly known as mountain laurel, is an evergreen shrub celebrated for its striking clusters of star-shaped flowers. Native to North America, Kalmia thrives in woodlands, along hillsides, and in rocky terrains, adapting well to diverse environments. The plant is a member of the Ericaceae family, closely related to rhododendrons and azaleas, and grows up to 3 to 6 feet tall, though some varieties can reach greater heights.

Kalmia’s flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, displaying a captivating palette of white, pink, or red hues often adorned with intricate patterns and dots. The flowers are arranged in umbrella-like clusters, creating a visual spectacle against the dark green, leathery leaves. Despite its beauty, Kalmia is toxic to humans and animals if ingested, earning it a reputation as both alluring and dangerous. Often planted for ornamental purposes, it is a favorite in gardens for its year-round greenery and showy blossoms.

```
In rugged soils, where shadows creep,  
The Kalmia wakes from winter’s sleep.  
Its blossoms bold, with hope they rise,  
A burst of color ‘neath open skies.  

Through rocky paths and winds that wail,  
It stands steadfast, it will not fail.  
A symbol bright, of dreams anew,  
Of faith held strong, and skies of blue.  

Oh, Kalmia fair, your petals sing,  
Of hope that blooms in the heart of spring.  
A lesson taught through nature’s art,  
That great hope lives in every heart.
