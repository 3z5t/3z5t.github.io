```
In the garden, where colors gleam,  
The Geranium blooms, a gentle dream.  
With petals bright and leaves so green,  
It tells the tale of things unseen.  

From soil to sky, it rises tall,  
A testament to efforts small.  
Each bloom a sign, a goal achieved,  
A dream fulfilled, a heart relieved.

The Geranium finds its rightful place.  
In every petal, joy does swell,  
A story of success to tell.
