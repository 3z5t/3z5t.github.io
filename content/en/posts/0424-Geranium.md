### Poem about Geranium


	In gardens bright where colors play,
	The Geranium holds sway,
	With petals bold and fragrance sweet,
	A dance of hues where blooms compete.
	
	Its leaves, so green, with scents so fine,
	Enshroud the blooms in soft divine,
	A symbol of a spirit strong,
	That thrives and blooms where hearts belong.
	
	From crimson reds to pastel pinks,
	The Geranium in sunshine winks,
	A testament to life's embrace,
	And comfort found in its own grace.
	
	Resilient in both sun and rain,
	It blooms with ease, dispelling pain,
	A beacon of stability,
	In every garden, wild and free.
	
	So let the Geranium’s bright array,
	Bring cheer to every passing day,
	With every bloom, may spirits rise,
	And find the joy in life's disguise.

	Inspire hearts and chase the blues,
	In every petal’s gentle sway,
	You light the path and guide the way.
