## Birthstone for November 18th: Anthophyllite

### Description of Anthophyllite

Anthophyllite is a rare and intriguing gemstone belonging to the amphibole group of minerals. Characterized by its striking fibrous or columnar crystal structure, it often forms in brown to yellow-brown hues, with occasional golden or greenish undertones. The mineral’s name, derived from the Greek words “anthos” (flower) and “phyllon” (leaf), alludes to its characteristic, needle-like crystals that appear almost flower-like when viewed under magnification.

Typically, Anthophyllite is found in metamorphic rocks and is more commonly used for industrial purposes, such as in asbestos products, rather than as a gemstone. However, certain varieties of Anthophyllite with translucent and well-formed crystals are highly valued for their aesthetic appeal and spiritual properties. While it may not be as widely known as more famous gemstones, Anthophyllite is prized among collectors for its rarity and the beautiful patterns it often displays in polished cabochons.

In the quiet hum of golden threads,  
Love’s soft whispers fill our heads.  
A stone of warmth, a heart’s embrace,
