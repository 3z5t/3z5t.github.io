## Birthstone for March 19th: Bicolor Quartz

### Description of Bicolor Quartz

Bicolor Quartz is a stunning variety of quartz that displays two distinct colors within a single crystal, creating a natural gradient or banded effect that captivates gemstone enthusiasts and collectors alike. The colors can range from subtle transitions, such as smoky gray blending into clear quartz, to vibrant combinations like golden citrine merging with purple amethyst (commonly referred to as ametrine).

This unique gemstone forms through natural processes, where varying concentrations of elements and temperature changes during its formation result in the distinct color zones. The interplay of colors within Bicolor Quartz makes each piece entirely one-of-a-kind, a testament to nature’s artistry.

Bicolor Quartz is primarily sourced from Brazil, Bolivia, and Madagascar, where it is carefully mined and crafted into jewelry and decorative items. Its versatility and beauty have made it a favorite among designers and gem enthusiasts.
