### Description of Calcite

Calcite is a versatile and abundant mineral found in a variety of stunning forms and colors. Its name is derived from the Latin word _calx_, meaning lime, as it is a primary component of limestone and marble. Calcite is often admired for its exceptional clarity and double refraction, a phenomenon where objects viewed through the mineral appear doubled. This unique optical property is one of the reasons Calcite is a favorite among collectors and geologists alike.

Calcite can be found in hues of white, yellow, orange, blue, green, and pink, making it a visually captivating stone. Its hardness ranges from 3 on the Mohs scale, which means it is relatively soft compared to other gemstones, but its ethereal beauty and symbolic significance make it a treasured gem. Calcite forms in a variety of geological settings, including sedimentary rocks, hydrothermal veins, and caves, where it creates breathtaking stalactites and stalagmites.
