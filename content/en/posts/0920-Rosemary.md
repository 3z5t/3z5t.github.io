## Description of Rosemary

Rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus, formerly known as Rosmarinus officinalis) is an aromatic evergreen shrub belonging to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other herbs such as mint, sage, and basil.

2. Leaves: The leaves are needle-like, about 2-4 cm long and 2-5 mm broad. They are dark green on the upper side and silvery-white underneath, with a leathery texture. The edges of the leaves curl downwards, which is believed to be an adaptation to conserve water in its native arid climate.

3. Flowers: Rosemary produces small, delicate flowers that can be blue, purple, pink, or white, depending on the variety. These flowers appear in small clusters along the stems and are attractive to bees and other pollinators.

4. Aroma: One of rosemary's most distinctive features is its strong, pleasant fragrance. The scent is described as woody, evergreen, and camphor-like, due to its high content of aromatic oils.

## A Poem about Rosemary

    "Rosemary's Whisper"

    In gardens old and new, a fragrant spire,
    Rosemary stands, its essence never tire,
    Needle leaves of green, with silver sheen,
    A living memory of what has been.

    Bride's bouquet and scholar's crown,
    In joyous feast and times of frown,
    Your presence speaks of faith untold,
    Of love and friendship, true and bold.

    Mediterranean child, sun-kissed and free,
    You've journeyed far across the sea,
    In kitchen, still-room, and sacred space,
    Your aromatic touch leaves its trace.

    Blue flowers small, yet rich in lore,
    Of Mary's cloak on distant shore,
    Of students wise and lovers true,
    In every sprig, old tales renew.

    Guardian of hearth, of mind, of soul,
    In your stems, time's secrets scroll,
    Remembrance keen and sharp as thorn,
    In your scent, the past reborn.

    Rosemary fair, in sun and shade,
    Your steadfast green shall never fade,
    Symbol of endurance, strong and sure,
    Through seasons' change, you still endure.

    In poet's verse and healer's hand,
    By grave and cradle, still you stand,
    A bridge between what was and is,
    Keeper of memory's sacred bliss.

    So let us plant and tend with care,
    This herb of legend, beyond compare,
    For in its leaves and woody stem,
    Lies wisdom's gift, a living gem.

    Rosemary dear, forever may you grow,
    In hearts and gardens, high and low,
    Your message clear through ages long:
    Remember well, stand true and strong.
