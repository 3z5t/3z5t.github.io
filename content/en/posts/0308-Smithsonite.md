## Birthstone for March 8th: Smithsonite

### Description of Smithsonite

Smithsonite is a captivating gemstone that derives its name from the British mineralogist James Smithson, the founder of the Smithsonian Institution. Known for its subtle yet mesmerizing hues, Smithsonite often occurs in a variety of pastel colors, including shades of green, blue, pink, lavender, and yellow. Its surface has a soft, pearly luster that gives it a distinctive and soothing appearance.

A carbonate mineral primarily composed of zinc carbonate (ZnCO₃), Smithsonite forms in botryoidal, stalactitic, or massive habits, creating smooth, rounded formations that resemble grape-like clusters. Its beautiful, translucent to opaque colors are caused by trace elements, such as copper (blue-green), cobalt (pink), or iron (yellow), that are present during its formation.

Smithsonite is not only admired for its aesthetic qualities but also for its relative rarity. It is typically found in secondary mineral deposits, where zinc ore has undergone chemical weathering. Significant sources of Smithsonite include locations in Namibia, Greece, the United States, and Mexico.
