```
The Restful Stone

In shades of gray and earthy brown,  
A quiet peace is softly found.  
Smoky Quartz, a calming glow,  
A whispered balm for hearts to know.  

Through misty hues, it gently calls,  
A place of rest where silence falls.  
No rush, no haste, just steady grace,  
A grounded calm, a sacred space.  

It holds the weight of worries past,  
Releasing fear, so peace may last.  
A grounding touch, a steady guide,  
A restful calm where dreams reside.  

Oh, Smoky Quartz, so soft, so wise,  
A tranquil light beneath the skies.  
You teach the soul to pause, to stay,  
And find its strength in stillness gray.
```
