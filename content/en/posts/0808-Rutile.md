```
Golden threads through crystal clear,  
An arrow’s path, a love sincere.  
With every gleam, it softly calls,  
To open hearts and tear down walls.  

A spark that flies, a soul’s embrace,  
Connecting hearts through time and space.  
Cupid’s gift in gemstone bright,  
A beacon shining through the night.  

Oh, Rutile’s glow, so bold, divine,  
A love eternal, strong, and fine.  
It weaves its magic, pure and true,  
An arrow aimed, connecting two.
```
