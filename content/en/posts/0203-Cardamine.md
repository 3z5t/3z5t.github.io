### A Poem Inspired by Cardamine

```
From the earth, a humble bloom,  
Awakens from the cold tomb,  
Petals soft, a whispering hue,  
Saying, "I dedicate myself to you."

No grand gesture, no lofty vow,  
Just a promise in the here and now,  
A quiet love, a gentle kiss,  
In each bloom, a world of bliss.

Through the frost and winter's reign,  
It rises up, unyielding, plain,  
A symbol of the heart’s intent,  
Of love that’s pure, without relent.

So let this flower, simple, sweet,  
Be the one that you shall greet,  
For in its petals, soft and true,  
It offers love that's made for you.
```
