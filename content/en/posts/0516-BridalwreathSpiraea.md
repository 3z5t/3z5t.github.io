### A Poem Inspired by Bridalwreath Spiraea

```
Beneath the May sun's gentle ray,  
A cascade of white begins its play,  
Bridalwreath blooms in graceful arc,  
A beacon of hope, a luminous spark.  

Each petal whispers of effort untold,  
Of roots that braved the soil so cold,  
Together they weave a wreath so fair,  
A testament to those who care.  

In gardens quiet, its branches bend,  
A symbol of toil, on which dreams depend.  
Oh, Spiraea, your blossoms declare,  
That beauty is born from love and care.
