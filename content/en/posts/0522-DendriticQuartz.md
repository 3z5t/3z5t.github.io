The Tree Within

In crystal clear, a forest grows,  
Its branches stretch, its spirit flows.  
Dendritic forms, so calm, so wise,  
A map of growth beneath the skies.  

Each line, a path, a story told,  
Of lessons learned, of courage bold.  
Through every twist, through every turn,  
The heart and mind find ways to learn.  

No rush, no haste, just steady grace,  
A quiet growth, a peaceful space.  
With roots below and dreams above,  
It mirrors life, it teaches love.

It shows the strength that lies in you.  
For in its lines, we see the way,  
To grow with joy each passing day.
