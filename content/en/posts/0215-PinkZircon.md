```
A gentle glow in hues of pink,  
A balm for hearts that ache and sink.  
With tender touch, it heals the mind,  
And eases pain, so soft, so kind.

A stone that speaks of restful nights,  
Of calm and peace, of inner lights.  
It clears the wounds, both deep and wide,  
And turns the tide of tears inside.

In every facet, strength resides,  
A healer, gentle, yet it guides.  
Pink Zircon, a gift of grace,  
To soothe the heart, and heal the place.
```
