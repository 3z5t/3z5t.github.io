```
In winter's chill, a bloom so bright,  
It speaks of warmth, of spring’s first light,  
With petals bold, and fragrance sweet,  
The Chaenomeles stands complete.  

A simple flower, yet full of grace,  
Its quiet strength, its peaceful face,  
A lesson taught by branches bare,  
That beauty blooms with little care.  

No need for frills, or lavish guise,  
Its charm shines through, no need for prize,  
For in its bloom, we learn to see,  
The power of simplicity.  

A humble flower, but full of cheer,  
That blossoms bright when skies are clear,  
The Chaenomeles reminds us true,  
That joy is found in all we do.
