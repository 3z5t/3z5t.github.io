Clear as thought, and bright as day,  
Danburite guides the mind’s array.  
Through prisms vast, it sheds its light,  
A beacon in the starless night.  

Its facets dance with wisdom's gleam,  
A spark of truth, a scholar's dream.

Of minds unbound, and hearts of gold.  

From wisdom’s well, it draws so deep,  
A treasure vast, for souls to keep.  
Danburite, your glow inspires,  
A flame that fuels our grand desires.

The boundless gift of infinity.  
In your light, our thoughts take flight,  
Broad and bright, like stars at night.
