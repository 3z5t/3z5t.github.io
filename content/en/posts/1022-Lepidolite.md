**The Quiet Shift**

In the quiet glow of violet hues,  
Where stillness speaks and time renews,  
A stone of change, a soft embrace,  
Transforming hearts with gentle grace.

From shadows deep, it clears the mind,  
Releasing fears that once confined,  
A sacred space for growth to bloom,

With every shift, a brighter view,  
Old patterns fade, the skies turn blue,  
A guide through change, a trusted friend,  
Lepidolite, the means, the end.

Embrace the flow, the ebb, the start,  
For transformation fills the heart,  
With every step, a new design,  
A journey led by light divine.
