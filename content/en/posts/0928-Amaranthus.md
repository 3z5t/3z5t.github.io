## A Poem about Amaranthus

    "Eternal Bloom"

    In gardens old and fields anew,
    A flower of myth and wonder grew,
    Amaranthus, with tassels bright,
    Unfading beauty, day and night.

    Red as blood or green as spring,
    Your colors make the heart to sing,
    Drooping plumes or upright spires,
    Kindling nature's vibrant fires.

    Ancient grain of gods and kings,
    Nourishment your bounty brings,
    In tiny seeds, a world unfurled,
    Strength to feed a hungry world.

    Love-lies-bleeding, passion's sign,
    Or Joseph's coat, in hues divine,
    Each form a story to be told,
    Of legends past and futures bold.

    Resilient plant of sun and soil,
    Thriving midst life's daily toil,
    Teaching us with silent voice,
    To stand tall, in life rejoice.

    Immortal flower of Olympus high,
    Defying time as years go by,
    In your persistence, we can see,
    A glimpse of immortality.

    Aztec altars bore your seeds,
    Mixed with hope and valiant deeds,
    Banned by conquerors, yet you rose,
    Triumphant over earthly foes.

    Now in gardens, fields, and plates,
    Your renaissance the world awaits,
    Superfood and beauty's bloom,
    Dispelling hunger, banishing gloom.

    Amaranthus, nature's art,
    Eternal symbol of the heart,
    May your lessons long endure,
    Of beauty, strength, and spirit pure.

    So may we learn from your long years,
    To face our joys, to face our fears,
    With grace that comes from roots sunk deep,
    And promises we strive to keep.

    Amaranthus, ever fair,
    Your wisdom with us freely share,
    That we might grow in soul and mind,
    Leaving fleeting cares behind.
