### Description of Geranium Zonal

**Geranium Zonal**, also known simply as zonal geranium, is a vibrant and versatile flowering plant native to South Africa.

The rounded leaves of the zonal geranium, often with a velvety texture, provide a lush backdrop to the vibrant blooms. These plants not only beautify spaces but also contribute to a calming and uplifting atmosphere, making them perfect for both outdoor landscapes and indoor décor.
