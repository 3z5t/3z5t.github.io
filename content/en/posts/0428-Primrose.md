### A Poem Inspired by Primrose

```
Awake, sweet Primrose, from your bed,  
Where winter’s touch has gently fled,  
With petals soft as dawn’s first light,  
You rise to greet the day so bright.  

Your beauty, delicate and true,  
Brings warmth where frost and cold once grew,  
A promise whispered on the breeze,  
That spring is near and hearts find ease.  

In gardens, fields, and meadows wide,  
You blossom where the shadows hide,  
A symbol pure of hope anew,  
Of love, of life, and skies of blue.  

Oh Primrose, in your gentle grace,  
You leave a smile upon my face,  
For in your blooms, I see the start,  
Of beauty born within the heart.  
```
