### Poem about Red Primrose

	In early spring’s tender embrace,
	The Red Primrose unfolds with grace,
	A splash of crimson ‘gainst the green,
	A herald of the life unseen.
	
	From shaded nook to garden’s edge,
	You bloom beneath the forest’s hedge,
	With petals bright as dawn’s first light,
	You banish winter’s grip from sight.
	
	Your fragrance whispers tales of old,
	Of love and hope and stories told,
	Of Persephone’s return anew,
	To bring the world a vibrant hue.
	
	In quiet moments, you inspire,
	A symbol of the heart’s desire,
	Your red blooms blaze, a fiery song,
	That life and love will carry on.
	
	So let the Primrose’s bold display,
	Remind us of each hopeful day,
	With every bloom, fresh dreams arise,
	Beneath the ever-changing skies.
