This gemstone was first discovered in Nova Scotia, Canada, in the 19th century by Henry How, a Canadian mineralogist, who lent his name to the stone. Howlite is primarily composed of calcium borosilicate hydroxide and is often found in nodular formations resembling cauliflower or brain coral.

Although Howlite is often used in its natural state, it is sometimes dyed to mimic turquoise or other gemstones, further enhancing its versatility.

Howlite is also lightweight and easily carved, making it ideal for beads, cabochons, and other intricate designs.
