The Flaming Flower, often referred to as *Gloriosa superba* or flame lily, is a striking and exotic bloom:

	In the heart of summer’s blaze,
	You rise with petals set ablaze,
	Flaming Flower, wild and free,
	A dance of fire for all to see.
	
	Your colors blend in fiery show,
	From red’s embrace to yellow’s glow,
	A passion burns within your bloom,
	Yet shadows whisper of your doom.
	
	In forests deep and lands afar,
	You climb and reach for every star,
	A beauty fierce, a potent spell,
	Of pride and peril, tales to tell.

	You blaze a trail through day and night,
	With caution’s call and ardor’s flame,
	In nature’s dance, you stake your claim.
