**Fields of Fortune**

In meadows green where clover grows,
With leaves that dance where soft wind blows,
A simple plant of modest grace,
Yet luck and love within its space.

Three leaves of promise, verdant hue,
With petals kissed by morning dew,
A fourth leaf found, a rare delight,
A charm of fortune in the light.

In fields where bees and blossoms meet,
Clover carpets earth so sweet,
With roots that nourish, leaves that cheer,
A symbol of the heart sincere.

O Clover, humble, yet so grand,
You bring good luck with gentle hand,
In nature's web, a vital part,
A treasure to the grateful heart.
