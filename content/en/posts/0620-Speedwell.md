### A Poem Inspired by Speedwell

```
In fields of green, where sunlight streams,  
A bloom arises, soft as dreams.  
Blue as the sky, it shines so bright,  
A symbol of success in quiet light.  

With roots that creep, and stems that rise,  
It reaches upward, touching skies.  
No stone, no thorn, can stand its way,  
For success comes to those who stay.  

Speedwell blooms where others fade,  
A gentle strength in every blade.  
In tender hues, a truth it shows:  
Success is born where perseverance grows.  
```
