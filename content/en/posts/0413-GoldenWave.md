Native to Madagascar, this plant is renowned for its vibrant, circular leaves that range in color from green to deep red, often highlighted with a golden edge.

### Poem about Golden Wave


```
In gardens where the sunlight plays,
The Golden Wave in splendor stays,
With leaves that shimmer, bold and bright,
A touch of gold, a pure delight.

A sea of waves in vibrant hues,
With edges kissed by morning’s dew,
It dances in the gentle breeze,
A vision of the summer’s ease.

Its petals soft, in pale embrace,
Add whispers of a tender grace,
Yet golden leaves, the starry show,
Bring warmth and joy wherever they go.

From Madagascar’s distant shore,
To every garden’s open door,
The Golden Wave, with colors bright,
Brings sunshine to the darkest night.

Resilient bloom, so strong and true,
A symbol of the life we pursue,
In every wave and every shade,
A promise of the dreams we’ve made.

So let the Golden Wave adorn,
The springtime sky, the coming morn,
With every leaf and every flower,
It celebrates life’s golden hour.
```
