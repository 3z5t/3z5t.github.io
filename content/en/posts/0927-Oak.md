## A Poem about Oak Tree

    "Sentinel of Time"

    Rooted deep in Earth's embrace,
    Branches reaching, filled with grace,
    Oak tree standing proud and tall,
    Witness to the rise and fall.

    Acorns scattered at your feet,
    Future forests, yet to meet,
    In your rings, a story told,
    Of summers warm and winters cold.

    Druids whispered 'neath your leaves,
    Kings sought counsel in your eaves,
    Thunder god's favored abode,
    Strength and wisdom you've bestowed.

    Mighty ship and humble chair,
    Crafted with such loving care,
    From your wood, so strong and true,
    Man has built his dreams anew.

    Shelter to the weary soul,
    Haven where the wild birds stroll,
    In your shade, life finds a way,
    Nature's balance on display.

    Centuries pass, yet still you stand,
    Steadfast guardian of the land,
    Through storm and drought, through fire and flood,
    Resilience flows within your blood.

    Oh great Oak, with branches wide,
    How many secrets do you hide?
    Of lovers' vows and battles won,
    Of quiet dawns and setting sun.

    Symbol of strength in many a tale,
    Your legacy shall never pale,
    In forest, field, or city square,
    Your noble presence fills the air.

    Teach us, Oak, to stand our ground,
    To spread compassion all around,
    To offer shelter, to endure,
    To keep our hearts and actions pure.

    As acorns into Oaks do grow,
    May we learn what you surely know:
    That greatness comes to those who wait,
    Patient with the twists of fate.

    So here's to you, majestic tree,
    Emblem of all we hope to be,
    May your kind forever grace our lands,
    Oak eternal, where wisdom stands.
