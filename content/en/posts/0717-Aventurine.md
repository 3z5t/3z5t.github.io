## Birthstone for July 17th: Aventurine

### Description of Aventurine

Aventurine is a striking, translucent variety of quartz that is known for its shimmering, sparkling appearance. This "adventurous" gemstone gets its name from the Italian word _avventurina_, meaning "by chance," which refers to the accidental discovery of the stone's sparkling effect while making glass. The shimmering effect is known as _aventurescence_, a unique optical phenomenon caused by the inclusion of tiny mineral inclusions, such as mica or hematite, within the crystal structure.

Aventurine is most commonly found in shades of green, but it can also be discovered in other colors such as blue, orange, brown, and even red. The green variety, which contains fuchsite inclusions, is the most popular and sought after. Aventurine is typically translucent to opaque, and it often has a smooth, polished appearance, making it a favorite in jewelry, such as rings, necklaces, and bracelets.

This gemstone is relatively durable, with a Mohs hardness of 6.5 to 7, meaning it is suitable for a wide range of jewelry designs, though it should still be handled with care to prevent scratching or chipping. Aventurine is found in many parts of the world, including Brazil, India, and the United States, and it has been treasured for centuries due to its natural beauty and metaphysical properties.
