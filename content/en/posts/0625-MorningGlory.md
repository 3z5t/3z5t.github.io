### Poem about Morning Glory


	In dawn’s embrace, with petals wide,
	The Morning Glory starts to glide,
	A trumpet bright in morning’s light,
	A fleeting bloom, pure and bright.
	
	With hues that kiss the day’s first rays,
	You paint the sky with vibrant blaze,
	Yet as the sun begins to climb,
	Your blooms retreat, lost in time.
	
	A symbol of the love we seek,
	In moments brief and tender, meek,
	You whisper tales of joy and pain,
	Of fleeting beauty’s sweet refrain.
	
	O Morning Glory, bold and rare,
	You greet the day with blossoms fair,
	In every bloom, a story sings,
	Of love, renewal, and the spring.
