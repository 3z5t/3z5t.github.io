Oh, Camellia, pure and bright,  
A symbol of love’s pure delight,  
Your petals soft, your fragrance sweet,  
A perfect bloom, in beauty complete.  

With every curve and tender grace,  
You mirror love’s enchanting face,  
In shades of white and softest pink,

From winter’s chill to spring’s embrace,  
You bloom in elegance, full of grace,  
A flower whose charm will never fade,  
In love’s embrace, forever laid.

A symbol of the love we share,  
A flower beyond all compare.
