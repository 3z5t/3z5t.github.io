### Poem about Camellia

	In winter’s hush, when days are cold,
	The Camellia’s blooms unfold,
	A tapestry of grace and light,
	Adorning gardens through the night.
	
	With petals soft as dawn’s first blush,
	You stand amidst the quiet hush,
	In shades of red and pink so fair,
	You weave a tale of love and care.
	
	Your leaves are cloaked in emerald sheen,
	A backdrop to the bloom’s serene,
	In every flower, a story told,
	Of admiration, pure and bold.
	
	Through storms and frost, you find your way,
	A beacon in the winter’s gray,
	Resilient beauty, standing tall,
	A symbol of the heart’s enthrall.
	
	So let the Camellia’s gentle grace,
	Inspire our hearts, our dreams embrace,
	With every bloom, a promise made,
	Of love and strength that will not fade.
