```
Beneath the sky, so vast and blue,  
The cedar whispers, "I live for you."  
Its roots run deep, its branches high,  
A bridge between the earth and sky.  

Through storms it stands, through years it grows,  
Its love endures, as nature shows.  
A quiet strength, a timeless grace,  
A guardian in its sacred space.  

So let the cedar teach us all,  
To stand steadfast, no matter the call.  
To love as deep, as strong, as true,  
As the cedar whispers, "I live for you."
