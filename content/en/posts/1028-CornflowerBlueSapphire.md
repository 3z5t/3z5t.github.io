## Birthstone for October 28th: Cornflower Blue Sapphire

### Description of Cornflower Blue Sapphire

Cornflower Blue Sapphire is one of the most cherished and captivating varieties of sapphire. Known for its deep, vibrant blue color, it takes its name from the striking shade of blue found in cornflower petals. This gemstone is a natural variation of the sapphire family, which is primarily made up of corundum. While sapphires come in various colors, the cornflower blue is particularly prized for its rich, velvety blue hue that evokes both elegance and serenity.

Cornflower Blue Sapphires are typically found in Sri Lanka, Myanmar (Burma), and other locations with active sapphire deposits. The color of the cornflower variety is due to the trace elements of iron and titanium within the corundum crystal, which reflect light in a way that creates the gemstone's signature blue. Cornflower Blue Sapphires tend to have exceptional clarity, with fewer inclusions than many other colored gemstones, making them highly desirable for both collectors and jewelers.

These sapphires are often cut into various shapes, including round, oval, and cushion cuts, to maximize their beauty and light reflection. The allure of the Cornflower Blue Sapphire lies not just in its captivating color but also in its durability. With a Mohs hardness of 9, it ranks just below the diamond in terms of hardness, making it an excellent choice for fine jewelry that will last for generations.

### Symbolism and Meaning of Cornflower Blue Sapphire: Perfect Straight Line

The Cornflower Blue Sapphire is imbued with profound symbolism, with its most significant meaning being "perfect straight line." This symbolism relates to the clarity and precision associated with the gemstoneâ€™s color and its metaphorical significance in life. A straight line is often seen as a symbol of focus, direction, and unwavering purpose. The Cornflower Blue Sapphire, with its perfectly balanced color and rare clarity, is believed to encourage these same qualities in those who wear it.

The concept of a "perfect straight line" is deeply tied to the sapphire's association with wisdom and clarity of thought. Just as a straight line represents a clear path, this gemstone is thought to help individuals navigate life with clear intentions and a sharp focus. It is believed to support the wearer in maintaining mental clarity and emotional balance, promoting a sense of purpose and direction in all aspects of life.

In the spiritual realm, the Cornflower Blue Sapphire is said to activate the third eye and throat chakras, enhancing intuition, communication, and the ability to see beyond illusions. This "perfect straight line" symbolism encourages individuals to stay true to their goals, aligning their actions with their inner truth and values.
