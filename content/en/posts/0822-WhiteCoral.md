Beneath the waves where silence dwells,  
White Coral forms in ocean wells.  
A gift of peace from depths unknown,  
A symbol pure, by currents honed.

Its pale hue whispers tales of grace,  
Of seas that heal, of time and space.  
A shield against the stormy tide,  
A calming hand, a steady guide.
