A golden star upon the ground,  
In quiet fields, your light is found.  
Through blades of green, you softly rise,  
A beacon bright beneath the skies.  

Oh fleeting bloom, so brief your stay,  
Yet in your glow, hope finds its way.  
A whisper of the sun’s embrace,  
A guiding light in nature’s space.
