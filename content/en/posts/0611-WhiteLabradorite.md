### Description of White Labradorite

White Labradorite, a member of the feldspar mineral family, is celebrated for its soft iridescence, which creates a mesmerizing play of light on its surface. While traditional Labradorite is often associated with vibrant flashes of blue, green, and gold, White Labradorite displays more subtle, pearly tones with occasional hints of rainbow hues. This understated elegance gives it a refined and serene appeal.

Found in regions such as Canada, Finland, Madagascar, and Russia, White Labradorite forms in igneous and metamorphic rocks. Its labradorescence is caused by the reflection and diffraction of light within its internal layers, giving the stone its signature glow.

With a hardness of 6 to 6.5 on the Mohs scale, White Labradorite is durable enough for everyday jewelry while retaining its delicate beauty. It is often cut and polished into cabochons or beads to enhance its luminous effect.
