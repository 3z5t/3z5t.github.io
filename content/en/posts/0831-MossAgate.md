```
A garden blooms within the stone,  
A tapestry of green, earth-grown.  
Moss whispers secrets soft and sweet,  
Of hearts renewed and lives complete.  

Through every leaf, through every vine,  
A story weaves, a love divine.  
Its gentle touch, a healer’s art,  
Moss Agate feeds the weary heart.  

From shadows deep, it brings new light,  
Through tangled roots, a path to right.  
Oh, guardian stone of earth and soul,

With every hue, with every bend.

To fields of love, to morning’s light.
