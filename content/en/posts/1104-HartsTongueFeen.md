### Description of Hart’s-Tongue Fern

The **Hart’s-Tongue Fern** (_Asplenium scolopendrium_) is a striking evergreen fern characterized by its glossy, undivided fronds that resemble a deer’s tongue, giving the plant its common name. Unlike many other ferns with feathery, segmented leaves, the Hart’s-Tongue Fern stands out with its smooth, elongated blades. Native to Europe, North America, and parts of Asia, this hardy plant thrives in shady, damp environments, often gracing woodland floors, limestone cliffs, and rock crevices with its lush green presence.

The plant’s resilience and unique appearance have made it a favorite among gardeners, particularly in shaded gardens or as a ground cover in damp areas. Its ability to endure cold winters and its preference for humid, sheltered spaces make it an ideal addition to fern gardens or shaded rockeries. Historically, the Hart’s-Tongue Fern was believed to possess medicinal properties and was used in traditional remedies to treat coughs, wounds, and digestive issues.

With its steadfast growth in challenging environments, the Hart’s-Tongue Fern symbolizes perseverance and beauty in simplicity, offering both aesthetic and practical value in its natural habitats and cultivated spaces.

### A Story Related to Hart’s-Tongue Fern

In ancient folklore, the Hart’s-Tongue Fern was believed to be a plant of revelations and clarity. One story tells of a young herbalist named Aelwyn who lived in a dense forest. Known for her wisdom and healing skills, Aelwyn was sought after for remedies and guidance. One day, a troubled knight named Eadric arrived at her door, burdened by a secret that weighed heavily on his soul.

Eadric confessed that he had betrayed a dear friend in his pursuit of glory, and the guilt consumed him. Aelwyn led him to a shaded grove where Hart’s-Tongue Fern grew abundantly. She explained that the plant was a symbol of solace found in truth. Encouraging him to confess and seek forgiveness, she prepared a tea from the fern and told him to drink it as he reflected on his actions.

Though it was a painful moment, the truth allowed them to reconcile, and their bond grew stronger.

Beneath the shade where sunlight fades,  
The Hart’s-Tongue grows in quiet glades.  
Its fronds unbroken, smooth, and true,  
A gentle green in shaded hue.

Oh, fern so wise, in forests still,  
You teach us strength, you test our will.
