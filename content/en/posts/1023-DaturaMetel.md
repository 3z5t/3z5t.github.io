### Description of Datura Metel

**Datura Metel**, commonly known as devil’s trumpet or angel’s trumpet, is a fascinating flowering plant recognized for its striking, trumpet-shaped blooms and intriguing mystique. Belonging to the _Solanaceae_ family, this plant originates from Asia and Africa and is now cultivated worldwide for its dramatic aesthetic and ornamental value. Its flowers are typically large, tubular, and fragrant, opening during the evening and exuding a sweet, intoxicating scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators.

The plant's glossy, deep green leaves and intricate flowers, which come in shades of white, purple, and yellow, make it a standout in gardens.

Historically, this duality of allure and danger has lent the plant an air of mystery and reverence.

Datura Metel thrives in warm climates and well-drained soil, often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. While admired for its beauty, it is handled with caution due to its toxic properties, symbolizing both the allure and the respect it commands in nature.

Beneath the moon’s soft silver glow,  
The devil’s trumpet starts to show.  
Its fragrant song, a gentle plea,  
Commands respect from earth and sea.
