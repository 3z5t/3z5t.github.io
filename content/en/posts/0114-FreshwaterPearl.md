## Birthstone for January 14th: Freshwater Pearl

### Description of Freshwater Pearl

Freshwater pearls are one of nature’s most exquisite creations, formed within the soft tissues of freshwater mussels and other mollusks. Unlike saltwater pearls, which are cultivated in the ocean, freshwater pearls are typically produced in lakes, rivers, and ponds. These pearls come in a stunning variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, from the classic white and cream to hues of pink, lavender, and even deep purple.

The process of forming freshwater pearls begins when an irritant, such as a small particle of sand, enters the mollusk's shell. To protect itself, the mollusk secretes layers of nacre around the irritant, eventually forming a lustrous pearl. Freshwater pearls tend to be less round and more unique in shape compared to their saltwater counterparts, often appearing in baroque, oval, or button shapes. These variations add to the allure and charm of freshwater pearls, making them highly valued for both their natural beauty and their cultural significance.

One of the remarkable characteristics of freshwater pearls is their ability to form in a wide range of environments, making them more readily available and often more affordable than saltwater pearls. They are prized in the world of jewelry and fashion for their understated elegance and timeless appeal. Their smooth, lustrous surface and gentle sheen give them a delicate and sophisticated look, which has made them a symbol of purity, beauty, and grace throughout history.

A lustrous orb of soft, pure grace,  
Reflecting love’s most tender face.
