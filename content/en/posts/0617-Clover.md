	In fields of green where shadows play,
	The Clover spreads its leaves of day,
	With trifoliate charm so bright,
	It dances in the morning light.
	
	A symbol of the luck we seek,
	In every leaf, a fortune speaks,
	Its gentle hues, so pure and green,
	Reflect the hope of all unseen.
	
	The four-leafed charm, so rare and true,
	A treasure that the skies bestow,
	In whispered winds and dewy morn,
	It brings the promise of reborn.
	
	O Clover, in your modest grace,
	You hold a magic we embrace,
	With every leaf, a tale of old,
	A story of good fortune told.
