## Birthstone for November 7th: Pit Amber

### Description of Pit Amber

Pit Amber is a rare and unique form of amber that is distinguished by its ancient origins and deep, earthy tones. Amber itself is fossilized tree resin, and Pit Amber specifically comes from ancient sources, often dating back millions of years. The term "pit" refers to the geological deposits where this amber is found—often in deep, subterranean layers, where the resin has been preserved under pressure and time.

Pit Amber’s color palette can vary, but it tends to feature deep golden-brown hues with hints of reddish or even greenish tones. It is valued not only for its beauty but also for the inclusions often found within it—small fossilized organisms like insects, plants, and even tiny air bubbles that were trapped when the resin first hardened. These inclusions add a layer of intrigue and mystery to the stone, making it a highly sought-after gemstone for collectors and those who appreciate natural history.

One of the most remarkable features of Pit Amber is its ability to capture a moment in time. These tiny inclusions act as a natural snapshot, providing a direct link to the ancient world that existed millions of years ago. The warm glow of Pit Amber, combined with its historical significance, makes it a powerful symbol of preservation, timeless beauty, and connection to the earth.

### Symbolism and Meaning of Pit Amber: Inclusion, Great Love

Pit Amber carries deep symbolic meanings that revolve around the themes of "inclusion" and "great love." The inclusions found within the stone, whether they are ancient insects, plants, or bubbles, represent the concept of preservation—capturing moments, memories, and life itself. This connection to life and time gives Pit Amber a profound symbolism, often linked to love, relationships, and the idea of inclusion in a greater whole.

The meaning of "inclusion" in this context is twofold. On one hand, the inclusion refers to the literal fossils trapped within the amber, representing life’s many facets and experiences. On the other hand, it speaks to the symbolic inclusion of individuals in love, relationships, and communities. Just as these ancient beings are preserved within the amber, it represents how love and relationships can preserve moments in time, creating a lasting bond.

The "great love" symbolism ties into the emotional warmth that amber exudes. Known for its golden, radiant hues, amber is often seen as a stone that nurtures compassion, warmth, and love. Pit Amber, with its deeper colors and ancient inclusions, intensifies this meaning, amplifying the qualities of affection, connection, and deep emotional bonds. It is a gemstone that encourages open-heartedness and a sense of inclusivity, making it a powerful tool for fostering love and compassion in one’s life.

### Stories Related to Pit Amber

Throughout history, amber has been revered for its beauty and spiritual properties. Pit Amber, in particular, holds a special place in ancient cultures due to its rarity and the preservation of life it represents. In ancient times, amber was believed to have protective and healing properties, with some cultures even using it as a talisman for love, fertility, and protection.

One particularly fascinating story comes from the ancient Greeks, who believed that amber was the tears of the sun god, Helios, crystallized over time. They would wear amber as a way to invoke the god’s light and warmth. Similarly, in Baltic and Slavic traditions, amber was considered a sacred stone, often used in rituals to protect the family and bring about love and prosperity.

Pit Amber, with its ancient origins, carries the weight of these centuries-old beliefs, and its inclusions offer a unique glimpse into the past, capturing moments of life that were otherwise lost to time. This sense of timelessness makes Pit Amber even more precious to those who seek to connect with the past while nurturing the present.

### A Poem Inspired by Pit Amber

```
In the depths of earth, so far below,  
Where ancient trees once swayed and grew,  
A secret lies in amber's glow,  
A timeless bond, a love so true.

With every bubble, every leaf,  
A story told from years ago,  
A trace of life, of joy, of grief,  
Encased in gold’s eternal flow.

The warmth it holds, a love’s embrace,  
Preserved within its golden heart,  
A charm that time cannot erase,  
A treasure that shall never part.
```
