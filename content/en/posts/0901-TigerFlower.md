### Description of Tiger Flower

The **Tiger Flower**, also known as _Tigridia pavonia_, is a strikingly beautiful bloom native to Mexico and Central America. Its name is derived from the vivid patterns on its petals, which resemble the bold stripes of a tiger. This unique flower belongs to the Iridaceae family and is often called "Tiger Lily" due to its fierce, vibrant appearance, though it is not a true lily. The Tiger Flower’s blossoms are large and eye-catching, featuring three outer petals in bold hues of orange, red, or yellow, with inner petals speckled with contrasting colors.

A fascinating aspect of the Tiger Flower is its ephemeral nature—each bloom lasts only a single day. However, the plant produces multiple flowers on each stem, ensuring a succession of vibrant displays throughout its blooming season. This fleeting beauty adds to its allure, making it a symbol of living passionately and cherishing the moment.

The Tiger Flower thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and plenty of sunlight. Its cultivation dates back to ancient civilizations, where it was valued not only for its beauty but also for its edible tubers, known as “Mexican shellflower.” Today, it remains a cherished ornamental plant in gardens and floral arrangements, admired for its exotic charm and vibrant energy.

Fierce as the stripes of a tiger’s might,  
The Tiger Flower blooms in fleeting light.  
A bold plea whispers from its hue,
