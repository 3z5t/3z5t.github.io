### Explanation of Periwinkle

**Periwinkle** (*Vinca minor*), also known as Lesser Periwinkle, is a perennial plant that thrives in shaded and semi-shaded areas. Native to Europe and parts of North America, this resilient plant is cherished for its evergreen foliage and charming, star-shaped flowers.

The Periwinkle plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 15 centimeters (4 to 6 inches) and spreads rapidly, forming a lush ground cover. The flowers are usually a striking shade of blue, although they can also be found in white and lavender hues. These delicate blooms appear in early spring and continue to grace gardens and landscapes through the summer.

One of the Periwinkle’s standout features is its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for adding color to shaded garden areas. Its glossy, dark green leaves provide a lovely contrast to its vibrant flowers, and its spreading nature makes it an excellent choice for covering bare spots and suppressing weeds.

### Poem about Periwinkle


```
In shaded realms where sunlight gleams,
The Periwinkle softly dreams,
With petals bright as morning dew,
And whispers of the skies so blue.

Beneath the canopy of trees,
It dances in the gentle breeze,
A cloak of green, a touch of grace,
A tender smile upon its face.

Through winter’s chill and springtime’s birth,
It brings a joy, a fleeting mirth,
A symbol of the love that stays,
In evergreen and blooming praise.

With every blossom, every hue,
A promise of the old and new,
The Periwinkle softly speaks,
Of timeless love and hopeful peaks.

In hidden nooks and gardens fair,
It spreads its charm and fragrant air,
A harbinger of spring’s delight,
In petals pure and colors bright.

So let the Periwinkle show,
The beauty of the world below,
With every bloom, with every cheer,
It casts away the shadows near.
```
