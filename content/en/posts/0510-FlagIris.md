### Description of Flag Iris

The **Flag Iris** (_Iris pseudacorus_), also known as the yellow iris or water iris, is a stunning aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands, along riverbanks, and in garden ponds. Known for its vibrant yellow blooms, this species stands tall on slender stems adorned with sword-shaped leaves that lend an architectural elegance to its surroundings.

Native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, the Flag Iris has spread across the globe, cherished for its beauty and adaptability. Each flower features three outer drooping sepals (known as "falls") and three inner upright petals (known as "standards"), forming a unique and graceful structure. Its intricate patterns of brown or orange veins add depth and character to the bright yellow petals.

Beyond its visual appeal, the Flag Iris is valued for its role in natural water filtration. Its roots can help remove impurities from water, making it a popular choice for ecological landscaping. However, it is also an aggressive grower in some regions, requiring careful management to prevent overgrowth. Whether celebrated for its ornamental value or ecological benefits, the Flag Iris embodies a timeless charm that enhances any environment.

The iris flower is famously linked to the **fleur-de-lis**, a stylized representation of the flower that has been used as a symbol of French royalty since the Middle Ages.

The Flag Iris, with its vibrant yellow hue, is thought to symbolize her golden path across the heavens. It was believed that planting irises near graves would guide the souls of the departed to the afterlife, adding a spiritual dimension to its significance.

Another legend tells of a medieval knight who, wounded in battle, sought refuge near a wetland where Flag Irises bloomed.
