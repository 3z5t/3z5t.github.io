### A Poem Inspired by Red Jasper

```
Beneath the red, the earth’s own heart,  
A stone of wisdom, a work of art.  
With steady hand and calm intent,  
It guides the soul through firmament.  

Judgment clear, as fire’s light,  
Guiding paths through darkest night.  
Endurance in the face of choice,  
A steady mind, a patient voice.  

Red Jasper’s flame, so warm and bright,  
A beacon through the storm’s dark fight.  
With every choice, with every step,  
The heart of courage shall not forget.  

A stone to guide, a stone to trust,  
In judgment’s clarity, it is just.  
The red that burns within the stone,  
A symbol of strength, the power to own.  
```
