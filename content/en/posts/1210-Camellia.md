### Description of Camellia

The **camellia**, an evergreen flowering plant from the _Theaceae_ family, is renowned for its lush, symmetrical blooms and glossy green leaves. Native to eastern and southern Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, camellias are celebrated for their graceful beauty and versatility. These flowers bloom in winter and early spring, bringing vibrant colors such as red, pink, and white to gardens during the colder months.

Camellias have been cultivated for centuries, both for their aesthetic appeal and for their association with tea production. The tea plant, _Camellia sinensis_, shares its lineage with the ornamental varieties. With their delicate petals and elegant form, camellias are often referred to as the "rose of winter." They symbolize a harmonious blend of strength and beauty, thriving in the most unlikely seasons.

The samurai believed the flower's balance and simplicity reflected the virtues he sought to uphold in his life.

One day, during a fierce storm, the camellia bushes stood firm, their blooms unbroken despite the battering winds. Inspired by the flowers' resilience, the samurai resolved to lead his people with greater strength and compassion. The camellias became a symbol of his enduring commitment to reason and justice, reminding his people of the harmony that could be achieved when intellect and emotion work together.

```
In winter's chill, where shadows creep,  
The camellia wakes from nature's sleep.  
Its petals soft, yet firm and bright,  
A beacon in the coldest night.  

With symmetry pure and colors divine,  
It whispers of reason, a truth so fine.  
Through tempests fierce, it holds its grace,  
A flower of thought, in time and space.  

Oh camellia fair, your lesson is clear,  
To seek the light, yet hold wisdom near.  
A bloom of logic, steadfast and true,  
A symbol of reason in all that we do.  
```
