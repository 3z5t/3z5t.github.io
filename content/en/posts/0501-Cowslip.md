### Poem about Cowslip

	In meadows fresh with morning’s light,
	The Cowslip blooms, a sweet delight,
	With golden bells that softly sway,
	Announcing spring in gentle play.
	
	Beneath the sky of softest blue,
	You greet the dawn with petals new,
	In clusters bright, you dance with grace,
	A humble flower in a sacred place.
	
	Your fragrance whispers tales of old,
	Of healing hands and hearts consoled,
	A modest bloom with virtues clear,
	You bring a sense of calm and cheer.
	
	As spring unfolds its tender hue,
	The Cowslip sings a song so true,
	Of fresh beginnings, simple charm,
	A floral balm to soothe and warm.
	
	So let the Cowslip’s golden glow,
	Remind us of the gentle flow,
	Of nature’s grace and purest cheer,
	In every bloom, a joy sincere.
