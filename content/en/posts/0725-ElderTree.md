### Explanation of Elder

The **Elder** (Sambucus nigra), often known as elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree renowned for its clusters of tiny, creamy-white flowers and dark purple berries. Here's an in-depth look at this multifaceted plant:

- **Appearance:** Elderflowers appear in large, flat clusters, each consisting of numerous small, star-shaped blooms. The flowers are white or cream-colored and are followed by small, dark purple to black berries. The foliage is pinnate, with dark green, serrated leaves that provide a striking contrast to the flower clusters.
- **Growth and Care:** Native to Europe and North America, the elder thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. It grows quickly and can reach heights of 10 to 15 feet, making it an excellent choice for hedges or naturalized garden areas.
- **Uses:** Elderflowers have a long history of use in traditional medicine and culinary applications. They are commonly used to make elderflower cordial, a fragrant and refreshing drink, as well as in desserts and syrups. The berries are used in jams, wines, and as a flavoring in various culinary dishes. Additionally, elderflowers have been utilized in herbal medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory, diuretic, and immune-boosting properties.

The elder’s versatility and utility have cemented its place in both historical and modern contexts.

### Poem about Elder

	In twilight glades where shadows blend,
	The elder’s blooms in whispers send,
	A tale of wisdom, soft and bright,
	Of ancient lore and healing light.
	
	With clusters white like winter’s lace,
	It graces earth with gentle grace,
	A guardian in leaf and bloom,
	Its fragrance fills the forest’s room.
	
	From blossom fair to berry deep,
	It tells of cycles, life’s own sweep,
	Of growth and change, of nature’s art,
	Of wisdom held in every part.
	
	O elder flower, with strength and charm,
	You shield and soothe with tender calm,
	In every petal, leaf, and berry,
	A gift of peace, a gift so rare.
