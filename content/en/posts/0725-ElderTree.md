Beneath the sun, where shadows play,  
The elder blooms, in bright array.  
Its flowers pale, its berries dark,  
A hardworking soul leaves its mark.  

From roots that drink the earth's embrace,  
It grows with purpose, steady pace.  
A gift of health, of drink, and balm,  
Its presence brings a healing calm.
