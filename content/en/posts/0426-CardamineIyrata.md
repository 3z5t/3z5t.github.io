### A Poem Inspired by Cardamine Iyrata

```
In the quiet spring, a whispering bloom,  
A flower so small, yet fills the room,  
Its petals pale, yet burn so bright,  
A symbol of love that takes its flight.  

Through the years, through the night,  
It stands in the shadows, ever in light,  
A token of passion, fierce and true,  
The Cardamine speaks of hearts that grew.  

Though distance may part and time may bend,  
The love it carries will never end,  
For in each bloom, a story told,  
Of a burning love that won’t grow cold.  

So when the world feels far apart,  
Remember the flower, and guard your heart,  
For love is a fire, both fierce and bright,  
And with Cardamine, it finds its light.
```
