	In woodland shades where sunlight gleams,
	Cardamine lyrata dreams,
	With leaves that curve like ancient lyres,
	And blossoms touched by soft desires.
	
	In quiet groves, it finds its place,
	A subtle touch of gentle grace,
	Amongst the moss and fallen leaf,
	It whispers tales of calm relief.
	
	Its petals pale, a tender hue,
	In shades of white and lavender blue,
	A dance of elegance so fine,
	In nature’s softly woven line.
	
	Through shaded realms, it finds its way,
	A symbol of the quiet day,
	Where grace and strength in stillness blend,
	And simple charms on which we depend.
