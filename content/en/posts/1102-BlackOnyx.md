### A Poem Inspired by Black Onyx

```
In the quiet depths of night’s embrace,  
A stone of stillness, time can’t trace.  
Black Onyx gleams, its surface pure,  
A mirror to the soul’s allure.  

With every glance, a mind set free,  
To ponder truths and mysteries.  
Its darkness calls, so calm, so deep,  
Where thoughts may wander, hearts may sleep.  

Through prayer or pause, in silent grace,  
It guides us to a sacred place.  
A symbol strong, of faith and might,  
The Onyx whispers through the night.  
```
