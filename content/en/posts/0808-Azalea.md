	In the quiet of the garden, where shadows gently play,
	Blooms a flower so enchanting, in hues both bright and gay.
	Azalea, fair and tender, with petals soft and light,
	You grace the world with beauty, a vision pure and bright.
	
	Your blossoms speak of temperance, a call to balance true,
	In colors warm and vivid, with drops of morning dew.
	Passion’s flame you kindle, in shades of pink and red,
	A symbol of the heart’s desires, where tender words are said.
	
	Yet fragile is your beauty, like love that’s sweet but brief,
	A fleeting burst of splendor, that leaves the heart in grief.
	Oh, Azalea, in your presence, we find both joy and tears,
	A flower of the moments, that mark the passing years.
