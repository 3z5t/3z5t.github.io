### Description of Cistus

The **Cistus**, commonly known as Rock Rose, is a resilient flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the _Cistaceae_ family and thrives in sunny, rocky terrains, making it a symbol of endurance and beauty amidst harsh conditions. The Cistus plant is renowned for its delicate, paper-like flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. These blossoms often have a characteristic yellow or crimson center, adding to their charm and visual appeal.

Cistus plants are evergreen and can reach up to three feet in height, with aromatic leaves that exude a resinous fragrance. This resin, known as labdanum, has been used for centuries in perfumes and traditional medicine. The flowers themselves are fleeting, often lasting just a single day, but they bloom in abundance, ensuring the shrub remains vibrant throughout the flowering season.

Beyond their ornamental beauty, Cistus plants play a vital ecological role. They are drought-resistant, making them a cornerstone of arid landscapes, and their blooms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The Cistus is a testament to the beauty and resilience of nature, thriving where many plants cannot.
