Cerussite is a beautiful, translucent gemstone known for its brilliance and clarity. This unique mineral, a lead carbonate, is most often found in colorless or slightly tinted varieties, although it can also appear in shades of pale yellow, brown, and gray.

Cerussite is relatively soft compared to other gemstones, ranking 3.5 to 4 on the Mohs scale of hardness, making it a more delicate stone. While its fragility limits its use in high-impact jewelry, it is still valued for ornamental purposes, especially in cabochon or crystal form.
