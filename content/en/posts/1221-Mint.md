Its square stems and small, lilac, or white flowers add a delicate charm to its robust presence. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, mint has long been used in traditional medicine, offering digestive and calming properties. Its ability to invigorate and purify reflects its symbolic ties to virtue and freshness.

A whisper of green, a breath so sweet,  
Virtue grows where roots do meet.
