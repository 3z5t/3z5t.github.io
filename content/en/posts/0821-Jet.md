## Birthstone for August 21st: Jet

### Description of Jet

Jet, a unique and mysterious gemstone, is a fossilized form of wood derived from ancient trees that were subjected to intense pressure over millions of years. This organic gemstone is often black or dark brown, possessing a smooth and polished surface that makes it both striking and elegant. Unlike most gemstones, Jet is lightweight and warm to the touch, characteristics that set it apart from other stones.

The origins of Jet date back to prehistoric times, with notable deposits found in regions such as Whitby, England, and the United States. Whitby Jet, in particular, has long been prized for its quality and beauty, becoming a popular material for jewelry in the Victorian era. Jet is often carved into intricate designs, making it a favorite for creating mourning jewelry and other decorative items.

Jet has a hardness of 2.5 to 4 on the Mohs scale, making it relatively soft compared to other gemstones. However, its durability and resistance to breakage when polished have made it a favorite for artisans and jewelers. Its deep black hue and lightweight nature make it an enduring symbol of elegance and mystery.

### Symbolism and Meaning of Jet: Forgetfulness

The meaning of Jet, “Forgetfulness,” carries both profound and practical significance. Throughout history, Jet has been associated with the ability to help individuals let go of past pain, sorrow, or trauma. It symbolizes the power to move forward, unburdened by the weight of negative memories, and embrace a new chapter in life.

Jet’s connection to forgetfulness is not about losing treasured memories but about releasing what no longer serves the soul. It reminds us that clinging to old wounds can hinder personal growth and happiness. Jet encourages emotional healing, helping its wearer to focus on the present and build a brighter future.

Spiritually, Jet is thought to protect against negative energy, acting as a shield that absorbs emotional and psychic burdens. This quality makes it a favored stone for meditation and grounding, as it promotes clarity and emotional balance. Jet’s symbolism of forgetfulness aligns with the idea of cleansing the mind and heart, enabling individuals to find peace and renewed strength.

In the Middle Ages, Jet was used as a mourning stone, worn to honor the memory of loved ones. Its deep black color was seen as a symbol of grief and introspection, but it also carried the hope of healing and moving forward. This dual role—honoring the past while encouraging emotional release—solidified Jet’s association with forgetfulness and renewal.

Legends from the Celtic tradition describe Jet as a stone of protection and purification. It was often burned to ward off negative influences or used in ceremonial rituals to cleanse the soul. These practices highlight Jet’s enduring connection to the concept of letting go and starting anew.

During the Victorian era, Jet became synonymous with mourning jewelry, especially after Queen Victoria famously wore Whitby Jet pieces following the death of Prince Albert. This association further cemented Jet’s role as a gemstone that helps process grief and facilitates emotional release.

### A Poem Inspired by Jet

```
A stone of shadows, sleek and bold,  
Whispers tales of times untold.  
Jet, the guardian of the heart,  
Helps the weary soul restart.

Through darkest nights, its light will gleam,  
A quiet strength, a healing stream.  
It holds no weight of sorrow’s chain,  
But frees the mind to heal again.

In polished black, its wisdom lies,  
To let go where the burden ties.  
Jet, the keeper of forgetful dreams,  
Unveils the peace where silence beams.
```
