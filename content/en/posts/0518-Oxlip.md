	In woodland shades where shadows play,
	The Oxlip blooms in soft array,
	With petals pale and whispers light,
	It greets the dawn and welcomes night.
	
	Among the leaves of emerald green,
	It stands where light is seldom seen,
	A gentle grace in shaded glen,
	A secret kept by forest fen.
	
	Oh Oxlip, in your quiet guise,
	You hold a beauty rare and wise,
	A symbol of the springtime’s grace,
	In hidden nooks, a soft embrace.
	
	With modesty and charm so sweet,
	You grace the earth where shadows meet,
	A flower of the woodland’s lore,
	A quiet bloom forevermore.
