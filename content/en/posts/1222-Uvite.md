## Birthstone for December 22nd: Uvite

### Description of Uvite

Uvite is a strikingly beautiful gemstone belonging to the tourmaline family, known for its vivid hues, which range from deep green to reddish-brown. Its name originates from the town of Uvito in Sri Lanka, where it was first discovered. While it is often mistaken for other varieties of tourmaline due to its vibrant color and glassy appearance, Uvite stands out for its unique crystal structure and energetic properties. The stone’s deep, rich colors give it a sense of vitality, and it is a relatively rare gemstone, making it a prized find among collectors and those interested in the metaphysical properties of gems.

Uvite is typically found in elongated crystals that have a hexagonal shape, often featuring both transparent and opaque areas, adding to its intriguing visual appeal. It has a hardness rating of 7 to 7.5 on the Mohs scale, which makes it durable enough for use in jewelry, but also delicate enough to require care in handling.

### A poem inspired by Uvite

```
The world is vast, and so is the mind,  
Boundless thoughts, no limits to find.  
Uvite’s glow, so bright, so wide,  
Opens the soul, where dreams reside.

With clarity sharp, like a polished gem,  
Ideas take shape, from within the stem.  
A mind unchained, no thoughts confined,  
Endless horizons, the world redefined.

It whispers of truth, of wisdom untold,  
A treasure of insight, more precious than gold.  
In the heart of Uvite, the vision expands,  
Broad thinking flows, like the sea’s endless sands.
```
