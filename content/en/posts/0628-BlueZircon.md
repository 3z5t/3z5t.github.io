## Birthstone for June 28th: Blue Zircon

### Description of Blue Zircon

Blue Zircon, often confused with synthetic cubic zirconia due to their similar names, is a naturally occurring gemstone with a rich history and an incredible array of colors. While zircon is found in a variety of hues, blue zircon is particularly prized for its vivid, sparkling blue tones that can range from light, sky blue to deep, oceanic blue.

Zircon is one of the oldest minerals on Earth, dating back over 4.4 billion years, and has been a favorite among jewelers for centuries due to its brilliance and fire. This gemstone forms in the Earth's crust through a combination of high pressure and heat, and its blue variety is caused by trace amounts of iron within the crystal structure. The natural blue zircon’s brilliance and dispersion—its ability to break light into a spectrum of colors—make it stand out from other gemstones, giving it an almost ethereal glow.

Blue Zircon is typically found in places like Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and some parts of Africa. Its high refractive index and strong dispersion make it an attractive choice for those seeking a gemstone with the brilliance of diamonds but at a more affordable price. It is also one of the few gemstones that can be found in natural blue shades, making it a unique and valuable choice for collectors and gemstone enthusiasts.

### Symbolism and meaning of Blue Zircon: Hallucination, dreaming heart

The deep and mesmerizing blue tones of Blue Zircon have long been associated with **hallucination** and a **dreaming heart**, symbolizing the journey into the subconscious and the vast expanse of dreams. Its ethereal beauty is believed to stimulate the imagination and encourage deep, lucid dreams, unlocking the inner visions and feelings that guide our desires and aspirations.

As a symbol of the "dreaming heart," Blue Zircon is thought to nurture creativity and inspire those who are open to exploration of the mind’s deeper realms. It is believed to help individuals connect to their innermost thoughts, providing clarity and insight into dreams, wishes, and unspoken emotions. People who are naturally dreamers or artists are particularly drawn to Blue Zircon, as it is said to amplify their imaginative abilities, infusing their dreams with inspiration and clarity.

The symbolism of "hallucination" doesn’t suggest a literal sense of delusion, but rather it refers to a heightened state of perception—where one’s mind is open to fantastical ideas, ethereal visions, and possibilities beyond the ordinary. Blue Zircon invites a sense of escapism, helping individuals reach new depths of emotional awareness, thus enabling them to dream freely and see beyond the confines of everyday life.

### Stories related to Blue Zircon (legendary, cultural, historical, etc.)

It was believed that wearing zircon could ward off the dangers of nighttime journeys and help the traveler navigate both physical and emotional realms.

In more recent times, Blue Zircon gained popularity during the Victorian era, where it was used in a variety of jewelry pieces, from brooches to rings. The gemstone was often associated with purity, wisdom, and protection. This belief was enhanced by the blue zircon’s ability to reflect light, creating an almost mystical aura around it.

One of the most intriguing legends about Blue Zircon involves its connection to dreams and spiritual realms. It is said that ancient cultures believed the gemstone could open the door to prophetic dreams, offering visions that could predict the future or provide guidance during times of uncertainty.

### A poem inspired by Blue Zircon

```
"Dreaming Heart"

In the blue depths of the endless sky,  
Where the stars above, like dreams, lie.  
Blue Zircon, glowing in the night,  
Calls to the heart with its soft light.  

A stone that whispers of the dreams we seek,  
Of wishes unspoken, of moments unique.  
Through visions bright, through light that gleams,  
It leads the way to the land of dreams.

A world of wonder, of colors untold,  
Where the heart's desires are softly bold.  
With each glance, a new vision unfolds,  
A future imagined, a story retold.

Blue Zircon, with your dreamy glow,  
Guide us where the mystic winds blow.  
In the dance of your light, we find our way,  
To the dreams of tomorrow, and the heart’s sweet sway.
```
