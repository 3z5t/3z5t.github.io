An old European tale tells of a kind-hearted widow named Eleanor, who lived alone in a small cottage surrounded by wild geraniums. Despite her solitude, Eleanor’s garden was a haven of color and joy, and she welcomed anyone in need with open arms and a kind smile. Her geraniums became a symbol of her generosity, spreading love and care to all who crossed her path.

One winter, a wandering artist named Oliver found himself at Eleanor’s doorstep, seeking shelter from the cold. Touched by her kindness, he stayed for several days, helping with her garden and painting the vibrant geraniums that adorned her home.
