### Description of May Lily

The **May Lily** (_Convallaria majalis_), commonly known as **Lily of the Valley**, is a delicate and fragrant flower that blooms in the late spring. With its dainty, bell-shaped white flowers hanging gracefully from slender green stalks, the May Lily is a symbol of purity and renewal. The flowers grow in clusters, forming arching stems that appear almost ethereal against their lush, emerald-green leaves.

The May Lily thrives in cool, shaded areas, often found in woodlands or gardens, where it spreads through rhizomes to form beautiful, dense carpets of blooms. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is widely cherished for its delightful fragrance, which has inspired countless perfumes and floral arrangements. Despite its beauty, the plant is highly toxic if ingested, a characteristic that contrasts its innocent appearance.

This enchanting flower has long been associated with springtime celebrations and is a traditional gift on **May Day** in many European countries, symbolizing happiness and the renewal of life. Its captivating beauty and sweet scent have made it a popular choice for weddings, often included in bridal bouquets as a symbol of love and good fortune.

In shaded woods, where whispers dwell,  
The May Lily rings its fragile bell,  
A fragrance soft, a glow so white,  
It graces spring with pure delight.  

Each bloom a mark of beauty rare,  
A fleeting gift beyond compare,  
With elegance in every sway,  
It welcomes life on May’s first day.  

A symbol of the heart refined,  
Of love sincere and truth aligned,  
The May Lily speaks with gentle grace,  
Of life’s exquisite, perfect space.  

Oh, May Lily, so pure, so true,  
Your quiet charm, a morning dew,  
Forever cherished, held so dear,  
A timeless bloom, year after year.
