The Larch, belonging to the genus Larix, is a majestic coniferous tree renowned for its delicate foliage and towering presence in temperate forests. With its slender, feathery needles and striking cone-shaped clusters, the Larch exudes an air of elegance and sophistication.

In Celtic folklore, Larch was associated with protection and warding off evil spirits, with branches often used to create talismans and charms.

You teach us to embrace life's chance.
To let go of the past and boldly stride,
Towards the future, with hearts open wide.
