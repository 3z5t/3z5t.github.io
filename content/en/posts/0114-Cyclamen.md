```
In shadows soft, where silence grows,  
The cyclamen blooms, a hidden glow.  
Its petals curve, a gentle sweep,  
A secret kept in quiet deep.  

No need for praise, no need for show,  
Its beauty whispers, soft and slow.  
A tender heart, its leaves reveal,  
A strength within, both calm and real.  

Oh cyclamen, your quiet grace,  
A refuge found, a sacred space.  
In you, we see a world serene,  
A soul unbound, a life unseen.
