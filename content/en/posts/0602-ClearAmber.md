It is lightweight and warm to the touch, with a hardness of 2 to 2.5 on the Mohs scale, making it suitable for jewelry and decorative items. Found in regions such as the Baltic Sea, the Dominican Republic, and Myanmar, Clear Amber is a rare and highly sought-after treasure.

The natural beauty of Clear Amber lies in its ability to capture and reflect light, creating an ethereal, almost dreamlike quality. This gemstone embodies a connection to the past while inspiring visions of the future, making it a perfect symbol of the realization of dreams.

### A Poem Inspired by Clear Amber

```
The Light of Dreams

Golden gem of ancient trees,  
You hold the whispers of the breeze.  
A captured sun, a crystal glow,  
A guide to dreams the heart will know.  

Through time’s embrace, you softly gleam,  
A bridge between the now and dream.  
In your glow, the path is clear,  
To chase what’s far, to hold it near.  

Your warmth ignites the soul’s desire,  
A quiet spark, a steady fire.  
Each glimmer speaks of dreams untold,  
Of courage, faith, and hearts of gold.  

Oh, Clear Amber, so bright, so true,  
You teach us all what dreams can do.  
With every beam, with every hue,  
You light the way for us to pursue.
```
