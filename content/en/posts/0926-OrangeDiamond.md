## Birthstone for September 26th: Orange Diamond

### Description of Orange Diamond

The Orange Diamond is a rare and captivating gemstone known for its warm, radiant hue that exudes energy and vitality. Unlike other diamonds, its fiery orange shade comes from the presence of nitrogen atoms within its crystal lattice, which absorb light in a unique way. The intensity of its color can range from light orange to deep, vivid shades, often accompanied by secondary tones of yellow or brown.

Orange Diamonds are highly sought after due to their rarity. They are considered one of the rarest diamond colors, often labeled as "fire diamonds" for their brilliant glow. With a hardness of 10 on the Mohs scale, they are as durable as any other diamond, making them perfect for jewelry that stands the test of time. These gemstones are frequently featured in rings, pendants, and other adornments, symbolizing warmth, passion, and enduring commitment.
