### A Poem Inspired by Black Poplar

```
Tall and steadfast, it stands alone,  
Through wind and rain, through dusk and dawn.  
The Black Poplar, with branches wide,  
A symbol of courage, a trusted guide.  

With roots deep planted in the earth,  
It faces all, proving its worth.  
In storms it stands, unwavering, bold,  
A lesson in courage, a story retold.  

So let us be like the poplar tree,  
Strong and brave, wild and free.  
In the face of fear, let courage flow,  
For like the poplar, we too will grow.  
```
