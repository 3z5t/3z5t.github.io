### Poem about Buttercup

	In fields of green where sunlight plays,
	The Buttercup begins its days,
	With petals bright as morning’s sun,
	A golden smile for everyone.
	
	So small and simple, yet so grand,
	A beacon in the meadowland,
	You sway with grace in springtime’s breeze,
	A gentle whisper through the trees.
	
	Your colors sing of joy and light,
	Of carefree days and dreams in flight,
	In innocence, you take your stand,
	A bright star in the verdant land.
	
	Let us rejoice in your sweet bloom,
	A symbol bright that chases gloom,
	With every petal’s golden hue,
	You bring a touch of spring anew.
