### Description of Alder

The **Alder tree** (_Alnus_ species) is a member of the birch family, renowned for its unique adaptability and ecological importance. Native to the Northern Hemisphere, the Alder thrives in wetlands, riverbanks, and moist soils, where its roots stabilize the earth and improve water quality. Its distinctive bark, often gray or black with orange undertones, is paired with serrated, glossy leaves and small cone-like fruits that persist through the winter.

One of the most remarkable traits of the Alder is its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its roots, enriching the soil for surrounding plants. This ability makes it a pioneer species, revitalizing degraded landscapes and fostering new ecosystems. The Alder’s resilience and adaptability have earned it a revered place in both nature and human history, often regarded as a tree of balance and transformation.

```
By river’s edge and marshy shore,  
The Alder stands, its roots explore.  
A bridge to realms both near and far,  
A sentinel beneath the star.  

With bark of gray and leaves of green,  
A dignity both strong and serene.  
Its solemn stance, a quiet grace,  
A guardian in nature’s embrace.  

O Alder tree, of soil and stream,  
Protector of the forest’s dream.  
Through trials vast, you calmly thrive,  
A testament to life alive.  
```
