```
In fields of green, where sunlight plays,  
The Clover blooms in gentle rays.  
Its leaves, a trio, soft and light,  
A charm of hope in morning’s light.  

Among its kin, a treasure hides,  
A fourth leaf rare, where luck abides.  
Faith, hope, and love its whispers bring,  
A vibrant heart, an endless spring.  

Oh Clover bright, so full of cheer,  
You lift the heart, you calm the fear.  
In humble fields, your beauty grows,  
A joy of life that always shows.  

With roots that bind, and blooms so sweet,  
You weave the earth beneath our feet.  
A symbol true of nature’s art,  
You teach us joy, you warm the heart.
