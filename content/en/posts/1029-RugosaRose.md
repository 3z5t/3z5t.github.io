Upon the windswept shore it grows,  
A guardian where the salt tide flows.  
With petals bright and fragrance sweet,  
It stands against the storm’s defeat.  

Thorny stems and roots so deep,  
A guide for those the waves do keep.  
Its hips of red, a gift of care,  
A beacon bright, beyond compare.
