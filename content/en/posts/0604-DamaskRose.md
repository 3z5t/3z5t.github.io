```
Soft petals unfurl in the dawn’s first light,  
A fragrant embrace, so pure and bright.  
The Damask Rose, with a heart aglow,  
Radiates beauty in the warm winds' flow.  

In the quiet gardens, where secrets are kept,  
A radiant bloom, by the moonlight swept.  
It speaks of love, of a soul so rare,  
Of beauty, grace, beyond compare.  

With every petal, a story is told,  
Of passion and love, both tender and bold.  
A rose that whispers, in each soft sigh,  
Of beauty that never will fade or die.  

Oh, Damask Rose, in your soft embrace,  
You carry the light of the human face.  
A symbol of love, a promise true,  
In your bloom, we see the world anew.
