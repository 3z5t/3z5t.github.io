### A Poem Inspired by Cacoxenite

```
Threads of gold within the stone,  
A map of wisdom, softly shown.  
Cacoxenite, your light profound,  
In your glow, the truth is found.  

Through realms unseen, the mind takes flight,  
A journey sparked by golden light.  
Each thread, a path, a story told,  
Of hearts unbound and spirits bold.  

Illuminating the conscious mind,  
Releasing fears, no ties that bind.  
In you, the self begins to see,  
A vast expanse, infinity.  

With every glance, with every gleam,  
You guide the soul toward its dream.  
Cacoxenite, a light that grows,  
In your embrace, the spirit knows.  
```
