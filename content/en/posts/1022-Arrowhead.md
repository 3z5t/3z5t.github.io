Native to North America but now found worldwide, the arrowhead is also appreciated for its ornamental value in water gardens. Its understated beauty and functional contributions to ecosystems make it a beloved choice for those seeking to cultivate both beauty and harmony in their landscapes.

```
By water’s edge, in silver light,  
The arrowhead stands bold and bright.  
Its leaves point true, a guiding hand,  
Through marshy depths and shifting sand.  

A symbol strong, of trust profound,  
Its roots hold fast in muddy ground.  
In whispered streams, its flowers bloom,  
A promise sure, through nature’s room.  

Oh arrowhead, you teach us well,  
To stay our course, in truth to dwell.  
A steadfast guide in life’s terrain,  
Through trials vast and joy’s refrain.
