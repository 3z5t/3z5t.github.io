## Birthstone for March 30th: Angel Skin Coral

### Description of Angel Skin Coral

Angel Skin Coral is a delicate and rare variety of coral prized for its soft pink hue, reminiscent of the blush of a cherub’s cheeks or the tender beauty of a sunrise.

This coral is formed by marine polyps in the deep waters of the ocean, often in sheltered environments that protect its delicate structure.

Unlike most gemstones, Angel Skin Coral is organic, making it unique among birthstones. It is carefully harvested from coral reefs, with strict regulations ensuring sustainable practices to protect marine ecosystems. Once retrieved, it is polished to reveal its smooth surface and gentle luster, making it a favored material for fine jewelry and decorative carvings.
