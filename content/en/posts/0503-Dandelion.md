### Poem about Dandelion


	In fields where golden sunlight spills,
	The Dandelion’s charm fulfills,
	A humble bloom with petals bright,
	Turns day to gold, and night to light.
	
	Its golden face, a sunny cheer,
	Breaks through the grass and whispers near,
	With leaves like teeth and roots so deep,
	It wakes from winter’s peaceful sleep.
	
	And when the flower’s bloom is done,
	A wish is made, the seeds are spun,
	They sail on breezes, hopes are cast,
	On gentle winds, dreams fly fast.
	
	Oh Dandelion, so bold and free,
	In every gust, you carry glee,
	A symbol of the strength to grow,
	Through every storm, through every woe.
	
	So let us cherish every hue,
	Of golden blooms and seeds so true,
	For in your fluff and vibrant light,
	You bring us joy and pure delight.
