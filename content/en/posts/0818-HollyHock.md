### Description of Holly Hock

The **Holly Hock** (_Alcea rosea_) is a strikingly tall and elegant flowering plant that belongs to the mallow family, Malvaceae. Known for its towering spikes adorned with vibrant, cup-shaped flowers, the holly hock is a quintessential cottage garden plant.

Its sturdy stalks and clustered blooms make it a favorite backdrop for gardens, adding a vertical accent and old-world charm.

The flowers bloom profusely during the summer months, and their nectar-rich blossoms attract bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds, making them a valuable addition to pollinator-friendly gardens.

Holly hocks thrive in well-drained soil and sunny locations, though they are hardy enough to adapt to less-than-ideal conditions. They symbolize resilience and beauty, often associated with strength due to their ability to stand tall despite harsh weather. Their timeless appeal ensures that they remain a cherished plant in gardens worldwide.
