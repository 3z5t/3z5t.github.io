## Birthstone for February 8th: Rutilated Quartz

### Description of Rutilated Quartz

Rutilated Quartz is a striking variety of quartz crystal that is known for its internal inclusions of rutile, a mineral made of titanium dioxide. These needle-like inclusions are often golden, red, or copper-colored, creating a stunning contrast against the clear or milky background of the quartz. The appearance of these threads or hair-like formations is what makes Rutilated Quartz one of the most visually captivating stones, often likened to celestial strands of gold or lightning trapped inside the crystal.

Rutilated Quartz can vary in appearance, from translucent crystals with delicate golden strands to more opaque varieties that have dense clusters of golden inclusions. The stones can be polished into cabochons or left as rough crystals, allowing their unique features to shine. It is primarily found in Brazil, Madagascar, and other parts of the world, and is considered both a gemstone and a powerful healing tool.

Rutilated Quartz is also known for its clarity and high vibration, often used in meditation and energy healing practices. It is said to enhance the energy of the environment and the aura of the person who wears or uses it.
