```
Amid the harsh and barren land,  
Aristata makes its stand,  
A slender stem, so meek, so fine,  
Yet holds a beauty so divine.  

Its seeds take flight on winds so free,  
A quiet hymn of destiny,  
No loud display, no grand design,  
Its charm in purpose does align.  

Oh Aristata, humble grace,  
You thrive within the toughest space,  
A symbol pure of nature's art,  
Of strength within a quiet heart.  

You teach us all to persevere,  
To stand in storms, to hold what's dear,  
For beauty lies not loud, nor grand,  
But in the soul, where roots expand.
