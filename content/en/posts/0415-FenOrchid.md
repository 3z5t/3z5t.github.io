In the quiet shade, where shadows play,  
A flower blooms, at the break of day.  
With petals pure, and colors bright,  
A symbol of grace, in soft twilight.  

Oh Fen Orchid, in your delicate bloom,  
You bring excellence, dispelling gloom.  
A perfect form, a work of art,  
A masterpiece that stirs the heart.

Of effort, strength, and pure intent.  
Like you, we strive to reach the sky,  
To rise above, to soar, to fly.
