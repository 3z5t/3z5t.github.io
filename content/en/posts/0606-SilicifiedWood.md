### A Poem Inspired by Silicified Wood

```
The Stone of Time

Once a tree beneath the skies,  
Its branches reached, its roots did rise.  
Through time’s embrace, it slowly changed,  
Its essence fused, its form rearranged.  

A blend of Earth, of wood, of stone,  
Its beauty born of time alone.  
Each ring, each hue, a tale does tell,  
Of nature’s art, of time’s own spell.  

Through fusion deep, through change profound,  
Its strength endures, its roots are found.  
A lesson carved in stone so clear,  
That change brings growth, there’s naught to fear.  

Oh, Silicified Wood, so bold, so wise,  
You teach us strength beneath the skies.  
With every line, with every hue,  
You show the power of what is true.
```
