### Poem about Balloon Flower

	In gardens green where shadows play,
	The Balloon Flower makes its stay,
	With buds like balloons, tightly bound,
	It waits for spring’s sweet, gentle sound.
	
	A promise kept in fragile guise,
	A world of wonder in disguise,
	It swells with hope and dreams unseen,
	A future bright, a promise keen.
	
	When morning sun and breezes tease,
	It bursts forth in a bloom of ease,
	A star-shaped bloom in colors true,
	Revealing grace in every hue.
	
	With petals soft and beauty pure,
	It tells of growth, of dreams secure,
	A symbol of what’s yet to be,
	A vision of our destiny.
	
	So let the Balloon Flower’s tale,
	Inspire hearts where dreams prevail,
	With every bud that starts anew,
	May we find our hopes in view.

	Your presence brings a warm delight,
	In every garden, field, and glade,
	You shine as promises are made.
