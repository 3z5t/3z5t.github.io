```
In the garden, where soft winds blow,  
A Balloom-Flower begins to grow.  
Its bud, like a secret, tucked away,  
Opens slowly, to greet the day.  

With petals tender, pure, and bright,  
It whispers of love, soft and light.  
A symbol of warmth, gentle and true,  
A gift of the heart, in shades of blue.  

The bloom unfurls, its beauty unfound,  
As its quiet grace spreads all around.  
In its silence, a message is clear,  
A gentle love, forever near.
