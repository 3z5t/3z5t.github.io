### A Story Related to Yellow Rose

Legend has it that the yellow rose owes its color to a tale of love, forgiveness, and transformation. According to an old Persian story, the yellow rose was once pure white, symbolizing the purity of love between a husband and wife.

In the end, the couple reconciled, and the yellow rose became a symbol of forgiveness and beauty born from hardship. This tale reminds us that even in moments of doubt or adversity, beauty can emerge stronger and more radiant than before.

Another story connects the yellow rose to the Victorian era, when its blossoms were exchanged between friends and family as a gesture of admiration and good fortune.
