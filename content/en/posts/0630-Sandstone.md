```
Beneath the earth, the stones lie still,  
Each one a lesson in patience and will.  
With every grain, a story is told,  
Of strength in silence, of quiet bold.  

The sun may set, the seasons change,  
Yet Sandstone stands, firm and strange,  
In its calm, we find our way,  
A steady guide, come what may.  

So walk with peace, let stillness reign,  
In every step, find joy in the plain.  
For in the balance, strength is found,  
In Sandstone’s arms, we stand unbound.
```
