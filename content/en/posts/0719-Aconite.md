### Poem about Aconite

	In shadowed woods where secrets hide,
	There blooms the Aconite with pride,
	Its helmeted blooms, a mystic show,
	In hues of twilight’s deepest glow.
	
	With petals shaped like moonlit crests,
	It guards the night with silent tests,
	A warning in its beauty lies,
	Of hidden peril, masked disguise.
	
	In ancient tales, its name resounds,
	In whispered lore, where magic’s found,
	A potion's touch, a sorcerer's bane,
	A flower both revered and plain.
	
	O Aconite, your darkened charm,
	Brings caution wrapped in floral calm,
	A beauty rare, with danger near,
	A paradox both loved and feared.
	
	In gardens where the shadows play,
	You stand as dusk turns into day,
	A symbol of the veiled unknown,
	In every bloom, a secret sown.
