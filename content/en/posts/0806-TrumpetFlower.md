### Description of Trumpet Flower

The **Trumpet Flower**, known botanically as _Campsis radicans_, is a vigorous, climbing vine celebrated for its vibrant trumpet-shaped blossoms. Native to the southeastern United States, this hardy plant thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions and can grow up to 30 feet tall, supported by trellises, walls, or trees. Its cascading clusters of flowers, typically in hues of orange, red, or yellow, create a stunning display that attracts hummingbirds and pollinators.

The Trumpet Flower's striking blossoms bloom in summer, bringing a touch of tropical splendor to gardens and landscapes. The vine's glossy, pinnate leaves add texture and depth, making it a popular choice for covering unsightly structures or creating natural shade.

Despite its beauty, the Trumpet Flower is also known for its tenacity. Its vigorous growth can quickly dominate its surroundings, requiring regular maintenance to keep it in check. However, its resilience and striking appearance have made it a symbol of boldness and vitality, an emblem of nature's ability to flourish with vigor and grace.

When Tahu fell in battle defending his village, the land mourned his loss. The tribe planted a tree on the spot where he fell, symbolizing his sacrifice.

Bold trumpets call from leafy spire,  
A blaze of red, a spark of fire.  
They climb the heights with steadfast grace,  
Adorning earth, a noble space.
