### Poem about Sunflower

	Beneath the azure sky so bright,
	Where golden rays embrace the light,
	The Sunflower stands with head held high,
	A radiant smile beneath the sky.
	
	Its petals wide, a sunlit crown,
	A beacon in the fields of brown,
	With every turn, it seeks the sun,
	A symbol of devotion won.
	
	In gardens vast or modest plots,
	Its bright blooms warm the coldest thoughts,
	A burst of cheer in summer’s grace,
	A golden touch, a bright embrace.
	
	O Sunflower, your strength and cheer,
	In every bloom, we hold you near,
	A steadfast light through days of gray,
	A reminder of the sun’s warm ray.
	
	With hearts uplifted, spirits free,
	We marvel at your majesty,
	O flower bold, in golden hue,
	We celebrate the joy in you.
