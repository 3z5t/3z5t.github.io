Golden petals, bright and pure,  
On waters calm, a flower so sure,  
With every bloom, the world is blessed,  
A symbol of hope, in peace, we rest.  

In quiet waters, it softly sways,

You shine with joy, you banish night,  
A flower of faith, so full of cheer,  
In your presence, heaven is near.
