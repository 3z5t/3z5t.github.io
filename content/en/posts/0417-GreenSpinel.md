## Birthstone for April 17th: Green Spinel

### Description of Green Spinel

Green spinel is a stunning gemstone that belongs to the spinel group, a family of minerals known for their brilliant colors and exceptional durability. While spinels are often overshadowed by more famous gemstones like rubies and sapphires, they have been highly valued throughout history for their beauty, rarity, and strength.

Green spinel, in particular, is known for its vivid green hues that range from soft, pastel greens to deep, forest-like shades. The color comes from trace amounts of iron within the crystal structure, which gives it its characteristic rich green tone. Spinels are typically transparent and have a brilliant luster, making them an excellent choice for fine jewelry.

What makes green spinel especially appealing is its rarity. While spinels in various colors are found in many parts of the world, green spinel is one of the rarer varieties, making it a highly coveted gemstone among collectors and connoisseurs. The clarity and beauty of green spinel make it ideal for use in engagement rings, earrings, necklaces, and other high-end pieces, where its vibrant color and sparkle can truly shine.

In addition to its striking appearance, green spinel is also appreciated for its physical properties. It is a relatively hard stone on the Mohs scale of hardness, registering between 8 and 8.5, which means it is durable enough to withstand daily wear without losing its brilliance. This makes it a practical choice for those looking for both beauty and longevity in a gemstone.

Green as the forest, deep as the sea,  
Spinel’s glow beckons, so wild, so free.

A beacon of faith, a guide to the light.
