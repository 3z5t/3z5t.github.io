## Birthstone for July 16th: Azurite

### Description of Azurite

Azurite is a striking and vibrant blue mineral, known for its deep, rich hue that ranges from a vibrant azure blue to a darker, almost navy shade. A copper carbonate mineral, Azurite forms from the weathering of copper ore deposits, often in combination with malachite, another copper-based mineral.

The mineral itself is relatively soft, with a Mohs hardness of about 3.5 to 4, making it easy to carve but also susceptible to scratching and wear. Azurite crystals typically form in a prismatic or tabular shape, though it can also be found as massive formations or in smooth, rounded cabochon cuts for jewelry. Its signature deep blue color is due to the copper content in the mineral, making it an eye-catching and desirable gem for collectors and spiritual seekers alike.

Historically, Azurite has been admired not only for its beauty but also for its believed metaphysical properties. It is often associated with the third eye chakra, which governs intuition and insight, and is said to help elevate the spiritual consciousness of its wearer.

```
In deep blue depths, the heavens call,  
A stone of insight, beyond the walls.  
Azure whispers guide the soul,  
To realms unknown, to make us whole.  

Through silent skies and vast, bright streams,  
We reach beyond the mind’s old dreams,  
In meditation, thoughts take flight,  
And bathe in Azurite’s pure light.  

Oh, sacred stone, the light you share,  
A silent guide through cosmic air.  
In every thought, a spark, a sign,  
To open paths, divine, divine.  
```
