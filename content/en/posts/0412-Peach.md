### Poem about Peach Blossom

```
In the tender dawn of spring’s embrace,
Where soft pink whispers grace,
The Peach Blossom unfolds with grace,
A fleeting touch of heaven’s face.

With petals kissed by morning’s light,
In shades of blush and gentle white,
It blooms in splendor, pure and bright,
A harbinger of day from night.

Its fragrance drifts on breezes light,
A promise of the season’s might,
A tale of prosperity in bloom,
A floral ode to life’s perfume.

In gardens where the branches sway,
And blooms adorn the coming day,
The Peach Blossom’s delicate dance,
Calls forth renewal, love’s advance.

So let the blossoms softly fall,
A symbol of the life we call,
With every petal, every sigh,
A reminder of the beauty nigh.

In spring’s embrace, we find anew,
The promise of the skies so blue,
In Peach Blossom’s gentle sway,
We greet the dawn of brighter days.
```
