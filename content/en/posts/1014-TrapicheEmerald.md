## Birthstone for October 14th: Trapiche Emerald

### Description of Trapiche Emerald

The Trapiche Emerald is a rare and stunning variety of emerald distinguished by its unique "spoked-wheel" pattern. Found primarily in Colombia, these emeralds display dark inclusions radiating from a hexagonal center, resembling the spokes of a wheel or the cross-section of a fruit. This pattern, caused by natural mineral growth and impurities, makes each Trapiche Emerald a one-of-a-kind marvel.

The vivid green hue of the Trapiche Emerald comes from trace amounts of chromium and vanadium, lending it the vibrant glow characteristic of high-quality emeralds. These gems are typically discovered in the rugged Andes Mountains, where specific geological conditions create their exceptional structure.

Beyond their visual allure, Trapiche Emeralds are prized for their rarity. They are challenging to find, even in regions known for emerald mining. This rarity, combined with their mesmerizing beauty, makes them highly coveted among collectors and gemstone enthusiasts.
