### A Poem Inspired by Lilac

```
Beneath the spring’s soft golden glow,  
The Lilac blooms in fragrant show.  
Its sudden charm, a fleeting sight,  
A burst of love, a soul’s delight.  

A nymph’s escape, a god’s despair,  
Her beauty whispers through the air.  
Each petal holds a fleeting spark,  
Of passions lit and moments stark.  

Oh Lilac fair, your bloom so brief,  
Brings hearts to joy, then leaves in grief.  
Yet in your scent, we find the tale,  
Of love that’s sudden, sweet, and frail.  

In morning’s dew or twilight’s haze,  
You gift the heart with fleeting praise.  
A symbol bright of spring’s embrace,  
Of love’s surprise, of beauty’s grace.
