### Poem about Morning Glory

```
In dawn's embrace, the Morning Glory wakes,
With hues of pink and blue that gently shake,
A trumpet blooms, in light of day’s first grace,
Its fleeting beauty, time cannot erase.

The petals spread, a burst of morning’s cheer,
To kiss the sun, then bow with day’s near end,
In fleeting moments, love’s sweet whispers hear,
A testament to dreams that hearts suspend.

In gardens bright, it climbs with fervent might,
To touch the sky with colors bold and free,
Yet as the sun climbs high, its blooms take flight,
A dance of grace, a vision to decree.

Oh, Morning Glory, your brief bloom imparts,
A lesson in the beauty of the now,
Embrace each day, with open, willing hearts,
For time will pass, but moments show us how.

So greet the morn with joy, as you arise,
And let your fleeting beauty grace the skies,
In every dawn, your petals softly tell,
The tale of love and life, where dreams may dwell.
```
