The Healing Glow

In the depths of green and blue,  
A gentle light begins to hue,  
A stone that whispers, soft and clear,  
Of peace and calm, a balm for fear.

Through every shimmer, every spark,  
It lifts the weight, it lights the dark,  
A tender touch to heal the soul,  
A precious gem that makes us whole.

Departing pain, it leaves behind,  
As hope and healing intertwine,  
With Blue Green Zircon by our side,  
We walk the path of peace with pride.

The past may linger, but no more,  
For in this gem, we find the door,  
To freedom, joy, and inner grace,  
Where pain dissolves in endless space.
```
