```
In sunlit groves where shadows play,
The Fig Tree stands with grace and sway,
Its verdant leaves, a canopy wide,
In nature’s bounty, it takes pride.

From ancient soil, your roots extend,
A symbol of life’s rich blend,
With fruits that hang in clusters sweet,
You offer blessings, rare and fleet.

In myths and tales, your name resounds,
A tree of wisdom, fertile grounds,
You bear the weight of history’s lore,
And teach us more than we explore.

O Fig Tree, with your branches spread,
You cradle dreams and hopes we’ve shed,
In every leaf and fruit we find,
A testament to nature’s kind.

Your presence, lush with green delight,
Brings forth abundance, pure and bright,
In gardens old and tales anew,
We honor all that you imbue.
