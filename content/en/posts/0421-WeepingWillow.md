### Poem about Weeping Willow


	Beneath the boughs where shadows weep,
	The Weeping Willow’s mournful song,
	In whispered rustle, secrets sleep,
	A tale of sorrow, soft and long.
	
	Your branches drape with grace and might,
	A curtain of both shade and grace,
	In twilight’s calm and moon’s soft light,
	You offer peace, a quiet space.
	
	In grief, you stand with stoic heart,
	A sentinel of tears and time,
	Where souls in silent moments start,
	To find their solace, soft and prime.
	
	Resilient spirit, bending low,
	Your strength reveals in gentle sway,
	A symbol of the pain we know,
	Yet find our hope in break of day.
	
	Oh Weeping Willow, calm and true,
	In every droplet, there’s a sigh,
	A whisper of what we go through,
	And dreams that live as time goes by.
	
	So let your branches speak to me,
	Of love and loss, of life’s sweet span,
	In every tear, a memory,
	Of journeys past and paths to plan.
