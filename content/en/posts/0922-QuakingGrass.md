### Description of Quaking Grass

**Quaking Grass** (_Briza maxima_), also known as trembling grass or shivering grass, is a charming ornamental plant belonging to the Poaceae family. Native to Europe and parts of Africa, it is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped spikelets that sway and tremble with the gentlest breeze. These spikelets, often golden or pale green, hang on thin, wiry stems, creating a mesmerizing effect that captures the movement of the wind in a poetic dance.

Quaking Grass thrives in well-drained soil and sunny locations, making it a popular choice for cottage gardens, wildflower meadows, and floral arrangements. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and produces its distinctive seed heads in late spring and early summer. Its unique appearance and graceful motion have made it a favorite among gardeners and florists alike.

Beyond its ornamental value, Quaking Grass plays an ecological role in supporting biodiversity. It provides shelter for small insects and contributes to the dynamic beauty of natural landscapes. The plant’s quivering motion is a visual reminder of the energy and excitement present in the natural world.

Oh trembling grass, with hearts of gold,  
You dance where whispers soft unfold.
