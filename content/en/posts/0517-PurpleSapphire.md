### A Poem Inspired by Purple Sapphire

```
The First Glimmer

A violet glow, so soft, so rare,  
A whisper of love lingers there.  
In Purple Sapphire’s tender light,  
The heart remembers love’s first flight.  

A fleeting glance, a gentle touch,  
The kind of love that gives so much.  
Unspoken words, a tender sigh,  
Moments cherished, time passing by.  

Through amethyst dreams, through lavender skies,  
The stone reflects love that never dies.  
A gem of firsts, a bond so true,  
In every sparkle, love’s hue renews.  

Oh, Purple Sapphire, keeper of flame,  
You call the heart to love’s sweet name.  
In your depths, a tale is spun,  
Of love’s first bloom, where all’s begun.
```
