## Birthstone for February 16th: Dravite

### Description of Dravite

Dravite is a rich, brown variety of tourmaline, a group of gemstones known for their incredible range of colors and crystal forms. Dravite, in particular, is prized for its warm, earthy tones that can vary from light yellow-brown to deep coffee or chocolate brown. Its hues are often reminiscent of autumn leaves or the deep, nourishing soil of the earth, making it a grounding and stabilizing stone.

Dravite is a relatively rare member of the tourmaline family and is found in various locations worldwide, including Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and the United States. Like all tourmalines, Dravite is characterized by its striking crystal structure and high clarity. It has a hardness of 7 to 7.5 on the Mohs scale, making it suitable for use in all kinds of jewelry, from rings to necklaces.

Dravite, like other varieties of tourmaline, is highly regarded for its unique ability to absorb and transmit energy. Its rich, earthy color is said to promote balance and harmony, making it a cherished stone for those seeking to connect with the natural world and its cycles.

### A Poem Inspired by Dravite

```
From the depths of earth, a gem is born,  
A stone of strength through night and morn.  
Dravite, with hues so rich and deep,  
A guide for those who wake from sleep.

Through shifting paths, through turns unknown,  
It whispers truths, its roots are sown.  
A grounding force in time’s unfold,  
A steady hand, a heart so bold.

In every facet, life's dance is clear,  
The unfolding story, year by year.  
With Dravite’s touch, we walk our way,  
Through darkened nights, into the day.
```
