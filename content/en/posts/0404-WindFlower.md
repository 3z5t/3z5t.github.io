### Poem about Red Anemone


```
In fields where spring's embrace is near,
The Red Anemone appears, so clear,
A flame of crimson 'gainst the green,
A vibrant tale where love has been.

Upon the breeze your petals dance,
In fleeting moments, hearts' romance,
Born of sorrow, yet bright with grace,
A flower's blush in nature's space.

O, Red Anemone, you speak,
Of passions bold and spirits meek,
In gardens wild and memories worn,
You hold the love of hearts forlorn.

Your beauty’s brief, yet deep and true,
A symbol of what we pursue,
In fleeting blooms, we find our song,
Of love's brief flame and strength prolonged.
```
