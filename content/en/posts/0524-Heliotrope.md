Heliotropes prefer well-drained soil and ample sunlight, making them a favorite for gardeners who appreciate their low-maintenance beauty and delightful aroma.

### A Poem Inspired by Heliotrope

```
Beneath the sky, where sunbeams play,  
The Heliotrope blooms, come what may,  
With petals rich in purple hue,  
It whispers love, both deep and true.  

Its fragrant air, a tender call,  
To hearts that seek a bond withal,  
A memory etched in twilight’s glow,  
A timeless vow, through sun and snow.  

Oh flower bright, you seek the light,  
And chase the day with steadfast sight,  
Your beauty speaks of love’s refrain,  
An endless chord, a sweet refrain.  

So let us learn, from Heliotrope’s gaze,  
To hold our love through all our days,  
For in your bloom, the heart can see,  
The power of love’s eternity.  
```
