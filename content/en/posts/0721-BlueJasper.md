## Birthstone for July 21st: Blue Jasper

### Description of Blue Jasper

Blue Jasper is a striking gemstone that belongs to the larger family of jasper, a variety of chalcedony, which is a microcrystalline form of quartz. This stone is particularly valued for its calming shades of blue, which range from light, almost pastel hues to deeper, more vibrant tones. Known for its smooth texture and rich colors, Blue Jasper can feature unique patterns and inclusions that enhance its aesthetic appeal.

The stone is commonly found in regions with rich volcanic activity, as it forms from the slow cooling of lava or the mineral-rich waters found in ancient riverbeds. Blue Jasper is typically opaque and is often polished into cabochon shapes or beads for use in jewelry. Unlike other gemstones, Blue Jasper is not known for its brilliance but rather for its solid and stable appearance, symbolizing tranquility and balance.

One of the defining characteristics of Blue Jasper is its connection to the earth. Its natural, earthy appearance is a reflection of its grounding energy. The stone’s soft yet stable presence provides an aura of calm and steady energy, making it an excellent choice for those seeking emotional balance and mental clarity.

As a stone of emotional adjustment, Blue Jasper is said to assist in releasing negative emotions, such as anger or sadness, while promoting emotional resilience and self-awareness.

Beyond emotional healing, Blue Jasper is also regarded as a powerful tool for mental clarity and focus. It is thought to enhance the ability to think clearly and make decisions with confidence, especially during times of emotional turmoil. By soothing the emotions and clearing the mind, Blue Jasper helps its wearer regain a sense of equilibrium, enabling them to navigate life’s challenges with a calmer, more grounded perspective.

### A Poem Inspired by Blue Jasper

```
Soft blue whispers, calm and clear,  
A steady voice, a heart sincere,  
Through restless storms, you lead the way,  
Guiding us through night and day.

With gentle hues, your power calls,  
To heal the soul when darkness falls,  
Emotional balance, peace in sight,  
You bring the calm, you bring the light.

Blue Jasper, steady as the sea,  
Your strength is found in tranquility,  
A stone of grace, of steady hands,  
You help us understand, and make demands.

In times of storm, you are the shore,  
A touch of peace, forevermore,  
In your embrace, we find our ground,  
With Blue Jasper, balance is found.
