### Description of Fire Agate

Fire Agate is a captivating gemstone known for its iridescent play of colors that resemble flickering flames. This rare variety of chalcedony is formed in volcanic regions, where silica-rich water flows into cavities and solidifies over millennia. Its fiery appearance is created by layers of iron oxide and other minerals that diffract light, producing hues of orange, red, gold, and green.

The gemstone often appears as polished cabochons or natural specimens, with its intricate layers giving a mesmerizing, three-dimensional depth. Fire Agate is not only cherished for its beauty but also for its durability, ranking between 6.5 and 7 on the Mohs hardness scale, making it ideal for jewelry.
