### Poem about Foxglove


	In shady glades where sunlight roams,
	The Foxglove stands with regal tones,
	With spikes of blooms, a purple haze,
	In woodland realms, it sets ablaze.
	
	Its bells, like whispers from the deep,
	Invite the fairies from their sleep,
	And as they dance in moonlit glen,
	The Foxglove blooms, a cherished friend.
	
	Yet, in its beauty, shadows lie,
	A warning hidden 'neath the sky,
	For though its charm may softly call,
	It guards a truth that shadows fall.
	
	Oh, Foxglove, with your mystic hue,
	You weave a tale both old and new,
	In every petal, magic stays,
	A flower of the ancient days.
