```
In fields where sunlight gently plays,  
The Daisy blooms through golden days,  
A crown of white, so pure, so true,  
With whispers soft in morning dew.  

Its petals wide, a heart revealed,  
A symbol of a love unsealed,  
Unfaltering through time and space,  
A bloom of trust, a gentle grace.  

Oh, Daisy fair, with steadfast gaze,  
You light the world in countless ways,  
A pure heart's pledge, your simple art,  
A token of the truest heart.  

Through meadow paths and gardens bright,  
You carry hope with morning light,  
Forever pure, your story told,  
A timeless bloom, a gift of gold.
