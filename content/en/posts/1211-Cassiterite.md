### Description of Cassiterite

Cassiterite is a mineral composed primarily of tin oxide (SnO₂). It is one of the most important sources of tin, which has been used by humans for thousands of years in various applications, from the earliest bronze tools to modern electronics. Cassiterite forms in a variety of crystal shapes, but it is most commonly found as a high-luster, translucent to opaque, reddish-brown or yellowish-brown stone. Its distinctive appearance often features a glassy or resinous surface that catches the light, giving it a striking sheen.

The mineral typically occurs in igneous rocks, particularly granite, and is often found in alluvial deposits, where the crystals have been washed into riverbeds over millions of years. While Cassiterite is prized for its role as a tin ore, its gem-quality specimens are also sought after by collectors due to their remarkable clarity and brilliance.

With a Mohs hardness of 6 to 7, Cassiterite is relatively durable, making it suitable for use in fine jewelry. Its deep, warm tones and striking luster make it a unique and eye-catching gemstone, though it is not as commonly found in mainstream jewelry as other gemstones.
