Its flowers are often arranged in tight clusters, forming a cheerful golden display that persists from midsummer into autumn. With a unique, slightly spicy fragrance, tansy was once used to deter insects and preserve food. The plant’s hardiness and vibrant blooms make it a symbol of resilience and beauty in nature.

Golden buttons in the sun,  
A quiet glow when day is done.  
In fields they stand, steadfast, serene,  
A simple grace, a peaceful sheen.
