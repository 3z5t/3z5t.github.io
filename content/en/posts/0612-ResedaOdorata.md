### Description of Reseda Odorata

**Reseda Odorata**, commonly known as the **Mignonette**, is a charming and fragrant flowering plant that belongs to the **Resedaceae** family. It is a native of Southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, but has since spread to various parts of the world due to its ornamental value and delightful fragrance. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial or annual, with slender stems and pale green leaves. Its small, four-petaled flowers are typically arranged in dense spikes, with colors ranging from creamy white to yellow and pale green.

The plant thrives in well-drained, sunny locations and can be easily cultivated in both garden beds and containers.

```
A flower blooms in whispered light,  
With petals soft, so pure, so white.  
Its scent a secret, sweet, untold,  
A charm that makes the heart unfold.  

In evening’s glow, it softly speaks,  
A fragrance mild, the air it seeks.  
With elegance, it calls to me,
