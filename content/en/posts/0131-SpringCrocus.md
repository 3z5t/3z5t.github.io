### A Poem Inspired by Spring-Crocus

```
In the stillness of winter's chill,  
A delicate bloom begins to fill,  
The earth with hues of purple bright,  
A promise of spring’s soft light.  

From snow and frost it dares to rise,  
A symbol of hope beneath gray skies.  
With every petal, fresh and new,  
The Spring-Crocus whispers, “Joy is true.”  

A fleeting moment, yet so grand,  
It blooms with beauty, hand in hand,  
With youth, with love, with life so pure,  
A joy that always will endure.  

Let its colors brighten your day,  
As it leads the winter’s cold away.  
With every bloom, a new start’s near,  
The Spring-Crocus brings us cheer.
