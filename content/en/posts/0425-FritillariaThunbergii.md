### A Poem Inspired by Fritillaria Thunbergii

```
In spring’s soft grasp, it blooms so bright,  
A flower bathed in pale twilight,  
With petals spun of gentle hue,  
A regal crown in morning’s dew.  

Though modest in its quiet grace,  
It rises strong, a noble face,  
A flower that, through all the years,  
Whispers of majesty, through tears.  

In every bloom, a tale is told,  
Of quiet strength, of hearts that hold  
The wisdom found in nature’s rhyme,  
Enduring through the test of time.  

So let the Fritillaria grow,  
A sign that through the cold winds blow,  
Majesty is found, indeed,  
In silent acts of thought and deed.
```
