### Poem about Fritillaria Thunbergii


	In shadowed glades where soft light weaves,
	The Fritillaria graces with gentle leaves,
	A pendant bloom in verdant shade,
	Where nature’s art in quietude is made.
	
	Its petals checkered, patterns fine,
	A tapestry where secrets intertwine,
	With every droop of bell-like bloom,
	It whispers tales of a hidden room.
	
	Elegance draped in mystery’s hue,
	A delicate dance where shadows pursue,
	In woodland depths where light does fade,
	The Fritillaria’s charm will not evade.
	
	Though subtle in its quiet grace,
	It bears the strength to find its place,
	Amongst the leaves and softened light,
	It blooms with beauty, pure and bright.
	
	So let the Fritillaria’s calm embrace,
	Guide you through life’s gentle space,
	With elegance, resilience, and grace,
	It leads you to a tranquil place.
