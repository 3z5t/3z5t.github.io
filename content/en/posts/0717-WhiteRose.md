	In gardens where the morning glows,
	There stands a flower, soft and slow,
	The White Rose, pure in form and hue,
	A symbol of a love so true.
	
	With petals white as winter’s breath,
	It graces life and honors death,
	A token of the sacred light,
	That guides the soul through darkest night.
	
	In wedding vows and solemn grace,
	Its beauty lights the sacred space,
	A whisper of both love and peace,
	Where all the troubles find release.
	
	O White Rose, with your gentle charm,
	You soothe the heart and calm the storm,
	Your presence speaks of love profound,
	Of purity where grace is found.
	
	In every bloom, a story told,
	Of timeless beauty, soft and bold,
	O White Rose, in your petals lie,
	The echoes of a love that’s nigh.
