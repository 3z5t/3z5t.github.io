### Description of Flower of an Hour

The **Flower of an Hour**, scientifically known as _Hibiscus trionum_, is a delicate and ephemeral bloom that captivates with its fleeting beauty. This small flowering plant belongs to the mallow family, Malvaceae, and is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa.

The plant typically grows to a modest height of 1 to 3 feet, bearing pale yellow or creamy flowers with striking dark purple or maroon centers. The petals are thin and velvety, giving the flower an almost ethereal appearance. Its name, "Flower of an Hour," aptly describes its short-lived bloom, as each flower opens for only a few hours before wilting, a poignant reminder of the transience of beauty.

Despite its brief display, the plant is a prolific bloomer, producing numerous flowers throughout its growing season. Its decorative appeal and ease of cultivation make it a popular choice among gardeners. The seed capsules that follow its blooms are another unique feature, resembling small lanterns and adding charm even after the flowers fade.
